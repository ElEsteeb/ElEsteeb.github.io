  <blockquote>
  <p><strong>Revelation 2:3-5 ESV</strong>
“I know you are enduring patiently and bearing up for my name’s sake, and you have not grown weary. [4] But I have this against you, that you have abandoned the love you had at first. [5] Remember therefore from where you have fallen; repent, and do the works you did at first. If not, I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place, unless you repent.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The church in Ephesus was commended for its perseverance, discernment, and rejection of false teachers. These are all critical qualities for any believer, especially in a world full of competing doctrines and distractions. Yet, Jesus issued a sobering rebuke: they had forsaken their first love. Despite their outward faithfulness, their passion for Christ and the mission of the gospel had grown cold.</p>

<p>This passage challenges us to examine our own hearts. Are we so focused on defending truth and resisting false teachings that we forget the heart of the gospel? While vigilance against error is essential, it should never overshadow our love for Christ and the joy of sharing His good news.</p>

<p>When we first came to faith, we were eager to share the message of salvation, overwhelmed by the love of Christ that transformed us. Over time, we may lose that fervor, becoming preoccupied with tasks, rules, or battles against falsehood. But Jesus calls us back to the simplicity and purity of loving Him and sharing His love with others.</p>

<p>Take time to reflect on your initial joy in Christ. Recall the passion and excitement you had when you first understood His love and grace. Acknowledge where your love for Jesus and the gospel has waned. Ask Him to renew your heart and reignite your passion for His mission. Jesus urges us to “do the things you did at first.” Recommit to sharing the gospel with love, compassion, and urgency. Make it a daily priority to spread His message in both word and action. While being watchful for false teachers is important, let it never replace the central call to love God and others deeply. Truth and love must always go hand in hand.</p>

<p>Let us live each day watchful, but with hearts overflowing with the love of Christ, sharing His gospel with the world.</p>

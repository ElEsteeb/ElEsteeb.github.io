  <blockquote>
  <p><strong>Revelation 3:4-6 ESV</strong>
“Yet you have still a few names in Sardis, people who have not soiled their garments, and they will walk with me in white, for they are worthy. [5] The one who conquers will be clothed thus in white garments, and I will never blot his name out of the book of life. I will confess his name before my Father and before his angels. [6] He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.’</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the church at Sardis, the Lord commended a faithful remnant who had not “soiled their garments.” This imagery speaks to purity, steadfastness, and a life set apart for God. These individuals stood firm in their devotion despite the spiritual complacency around them. Their reward? To walk with Christ in white—an emblem of victory, righteousness, and eternal glory (Revelation 19:8).</p>

<p>This promise of being “worthy” does not rest in our merit but in the grace of God. Jesus Himself is the one who makes us holy, clothing us in His righteousness (Isaiah 61:10). Yet, we are called to persevere, to remain faithful, and to “conquer” the trials and temptations of this life. This conquering is not through our strength but through reliance on Christ, who overcame the world (John 16:33).</p>

<p>The assurance that our names will never be blotted out of the book of life is a powerful motivator. It reminds us of the eternal security and joy promised to those who remain faithful. In addition, Christ’s promise to confess our names before His Father and the angels is deeply personal and affirming (Matthew 10:32). To be acknowledged by the King of Kings is a reward far surpassing any earthly recognition. Infinitely better than the reputation the others in Sardinia were pretending to have (Revelation 3:1).</p>

<p>As you reflect on this passage, take heart in the victory promised to all who remain faithful. Let your life be marked by purity and perseverance, trusting in the one who calls you to walk in white alongside Him. The battle may be fierce, but the reward is eternal and glorious. Stay the course, for your name is written in heaven (Luke 10:20).</p>

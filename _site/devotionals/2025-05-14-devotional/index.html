<div class="scripture">
  "Then the angel showed me the river of the water of life, bright as crystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb through the middle of the street of the city; also, on either side of the river, the tree of life with its twelve kinds of fruit, yielding its fruit each month. The leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations." (Revelation 22:1–2, ESV)
</div>

<p>In the final chapter of Revelation, John sees a vision that brings the story of Scripture full circle. The river of the water of life, flowing from the very throne of God and of the Lamb, is not merely symbolic—it is Eden restored, the temple renewed, and the presence of God unleashed to all creation.</p>

<p>This river echoes the original stream in Genesis 2:10, which watered Eden and flowed outward to the world. But here, the source is not merely a garden—it is God Himself. Revelation 21:22 has already told us that there is no temple in the New Jerusalem, “for its temple is the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb.” The river flows from that holy source, crystal-clear and unstoppable.</p>

<p>Contrast this with the sea in Revelation. The sea—chaotic, dark, and deep—was the source of the beast and false power (Rev. 13:1). But in the new creation, “the sea was no more” (Rev. 21:1). In its place comes the river—clarity instead of confusion, life instead of fear, God’s Spirit instead of godless power. This reflects Psalm 46:4: “There is a river whose streams make glad the city of God, the holy habitation of the Most High.”</p>

<p>Ezekiel saw this too. In Ezekiel 47:1–12, a trickle from the temple threshold becomes a river so vast it cannot be crossed, bringing life wherever it goes. Trees spring up beside it, bearing fruit and leaves for healing. Revelation completes this vision: the river now flows from the throne, and the Tree of Life reappears—no longer barred, no longer guarded, but yielding fruit continually and healing the nations.</p>

<p>And this Tree is no ordinary tree. It is the Cross. Paul wrote, “Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us—for it is written, ‘Cursed is everyone who is hanged on a tree’” (Gal. 3:13). What was meant for death has become the tree of life. The fruit of this tree is the gospel—the power of God for salvation (Rom. 1:16)—and its leaves are the healing mercy of God, extended to the ends of the earth.</p>

<p>Jesus told the woman at the well in John 4:13–14 that those who drink the water He gives will never thirst again. And again in John 7:38, He said, “Whoever believes in me, as the Scripture has said, ‘Out of his heart will flow rivers of living water.’” That is the life we live now. We drink deeply of Christ and become conduits of His grace.</p>

<p>And note this: the nations are still here. Even in this ultimate vision of renewal, the world is not abandoned—it is healed. Isaiah wrote that “by his wounds we are healed” (Isa. 53:5), and that healing now flows outward through His Church. Every time we pray “Thy kingdom come,” we are praying for the river to rise, for the fruit to feed the hungry, for the healing leaves to be sent out through our mission. We do not wait idly—we go, making disciples of all nations (Matt. 28:19), carrying the fruit and the leaves with us.</p>

<p>This is our present hope and calling. Christ crucified is our Tree of Life, the Spirit in us is the river of life, and the world is waiting for the healing we now carry.</p>

<p>Are you drinking daily from the river that flows from Christ, or are you sipping from the sea of the world? How can you bring the “leaves for the healing of the nations” into your own community today?In what ways does your life reflect the Tree of Life—Christ crucified and risen?</p>

<p>You are part of a divine stream that brings life wherever it flows. Let your heart be planted by the river of God’s presence (Psalm 1:3), and bear fruit in every season. The world is thirsty, but the water is flowing. The world is broken, but the leaves are healing. Go forth in the power of the Cross—behold the Kingdom come!</p>

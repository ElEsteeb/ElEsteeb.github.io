  <blockquote>
  <p><strong>Revelation 2:24-29 ESV</strong>
“But to the rest of you in Thyatira, who do not hold this teaching, who have not learned what some call the deep things of Satan, to you I say, I do not lay on you any other burden. [25] Only hold fast what you have until I come. [26] The one who conquers and who keeps my works until the end, to him I will give authority over the nations, [27] and he will rule them with a rod of iron, as when earthen pots are broken in pieces, even as I myself have received authority from my Father. And I will give him the morning star. He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.’</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jesus commends the faithful believers in Thyatira who have resisted false teachings. They have not succumbed to the “deep things of Satan,” likely a reference to deceptive doctrines masquerading as profound truths (1 Timothy 4:1). These believers demonstrate what Jesus taught in John 8:31—true disciples abide in His Word, not the lies of the world.</p>

<p>Jesus reassures them that He does not “lay on you any other burden.” This echoes His earlier promise in Matthew 11:28-30, where He calls His yoke easy and His burden light. The command to “hold fast what you have until I come” underscores the need for perseverance, a theme repeated in Hebrews 10:23, which encourages us to “hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for He who promised is faithful.”</p>

<p>To the one who overcomes, Jesus promises authority over the nations, reflecting Psalm 2:8-9, where the Messiah is given the nations as His inheritance and rules with a rod of iron. This promise assures us that those who endure will share in Christ’s victory (Romans 8:17). The “morning star” symbolizes the ultimate reward: Jesus Himself, as revealed in Revelation 22:16, where He declares, “I am the root and the descendant of David, the bright morning star.”</p>

<p>The closing exhortation, “He who has an ear, let him hear,” emphasizes the urgency of heeding the Spirit’s words. It recalls Jesus’ warning in Matthew 13:9, urging listeners to respond to His teaching with understanding and obedience. This passage challenges us to remain steadfast (1 Corinthians 15:58), discerning (1 John 4:1), and focused on Christ’s promises (Philippians 3:14), knowing that faithfulness will lead to eternal fellowship with Him.</p>

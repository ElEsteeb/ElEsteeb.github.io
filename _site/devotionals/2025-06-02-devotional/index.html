<div class="scripture">
  "For it was fitting that he, for whom and by whom all things exist, in bringing many sons to glory, should make the founder of their salvation perfect through suffering. For he who sanctifies and those who are sanctified all have one source. That is why he is not ashamed to call them brothers, saying, “I will tell of your name to my brothers; in the midst of the congregation I will sing your praise.” And again, “I will put my trust in him.” And again, “Behold, I and the children God has given me.” (Hebrews 2:10-13, ESV)
</div>

<p>In the unfolding glory of Hebrews, we see that Jesus is not only exalted above the angels: He is also revealed as the founder of our salvation, made “perfect through suffering.” This does not mean He was ever lacking in holiness or virtue. Rather, through His suffering, the perfection of His obedience and love was revealed to creation. The cross was not a change in Christ’s nature, it was a revelation of it.</p>

<p>Here, the writer draws us into the mystery of the Incarnation: the Creator steps into His own creation, not as a phantom, but as true man. He shares our humanity completely. “He who sanctifies and those who are sanctified all have one source” (v. 11). That source is God Himself. In this shared origin, Jesus is not ashamed to call us brothers.</p>

<p>Let that sink in. The King of Glory, through whom the worlds were made, calls us brothers: family. He quotes Psalm 22:22 and Isaiah 8:17-18, declaring His solidarity with us. He doesn’t just redeem us: He relates to us.</p>

<p>He bore suffering not for His sins, but for ours. He passed through death not to prove a point, but because we were dead, and he came here to rescue us! By doing so, He is perfectly revealed as both Lord and Savior, Judge and Justifier, King and Brother.</p>

<p>He, the Creator of all, came into creation to create a new creation. He was the Word by which the original creation was spoken into existence (John 1:3, Hebrews 1:2), and through His suffering here, He is revealed to be the Word made flesh (John 1:14) by which the new creation is again spoken into existence through Him. (2 Corinthians 5:17, Revelation 21:5)</p>

<p>And so, when we suffer, when we walk through affliction, we are not alone. Jesus has gone before us. And now, as inheritors with Him, we walk in the confidence that our suffering has purpose. As Paul says, that suffering “is preparing for us an eternal weight of glory beyond all comparison”! (2 Corinthians 4:17). Our salvation is secure, and our Savior calls us brothers! What a wonderous Savior!</p>

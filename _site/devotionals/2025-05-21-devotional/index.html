  <p><img src="https://sitemedia.esteeb.com/file/esteebcomsitemedia/devotional_images/Hebrews/Heb-1_1-2.jpg?raw=true" alt="Revelation 21:5.jpg" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;" /></p>

<div class="scripture">
  "Long ago, at many times and in many ways, God spoke to our fathers by the prophets, but in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed the heir of all things, through whom also he created the world." (Hebrews 1:1-2, ESV)
</div>

<p>The book of Hebrews opens without introduction or pleasantries. There’s no named author, no clear audience, and no personal greeting. Instead, the writer charges straight into the heart of the message: God has spoken—finally and fully—in His Son. The prophets of old were God’s messengers, speaking truth in shadows, symbols, and fragments. But now, in these “last days,” God has given us something infinitely better: the Son Himself.</p>

<p>The identity of Jesus is packed into just a few words:
He is the Son, the Heir, and the Agent of Creation.
These aren’t just titles—they reveal His nature and His role in all of history. Just as a son is heir to his father’s estate, Jesus is the heir of all things (cf. Psalm 2:7–8). Everything that exists—every nation, every throne, every soul—ultimately belongs to Him.</p>

<p>More than that, He is the very one “through whom [God] created the world.” Jesus isn’t just the heir of creation; He is its architect. As John 1:1–3 says, “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God… All things were made through him, and without him was not any thing made that was made.”</p>

<p>This links directly to Genesis 1, where the world was spoken into existence. Jesus is that divine Word—the voice of God in creation. Now, He is also the voice of God in redemption. The One who created by His Word now speaks life again to those who will hear Him.</p>

<p>Paul affirms this same truth in Colossians 1:16, “For by him all things were created, in heaven and on earth… all things were created through him and for him.”</p>

<p>We were made through Him—and for Him.</p>

<p>Jesus is not a footnote in history. He is its Author and its Goal. From the first light of creation to the final word of Revelation, Jesus is the main character. He is the final Word God has spoken, the full revelation of who God is (John 1:18), and the One who now calls us to listen and follow.</p>

<p>Hebrews begins by asking us not to look back, but to look up—not to long for former days or partial revelations, but to fix our eyes on the Son. In a world full of many voices, there is one voice that matters most, “This is my beloved Son… listen to him.” (Mark 9:7)</p>

<p>So let us listen. Let us lean in and hear the One through whom the world was made and to whom it belongs. Jesus is better.</p>

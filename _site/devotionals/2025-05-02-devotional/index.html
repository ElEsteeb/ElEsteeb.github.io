<div class="scripture">
  “Then I saw a great white throne and him who was seated on it. From his presence earth and sky fled away, and no place was found for them. And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and books were opened. Then another book was opened, which is the book of life. And the dead were judged by what was written in the books, according to what they had done. And the sea gave up the dead who were in it, Death and Hades gave up the dead who were in them, and they were judged, each one of them, according to what they had done. Then Death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire. And if anyone’s name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire." (Revelation 20:11–15, ESV)
</div>

<p>The “great white throne” judgment scene in Revelation 20:11–15 is among the most sobering in all of Scripture. It’s the final reckoning, the moment when every life is laid bare before the enthroned Christ. Many readers hesitate to see this as including believers, fearing that it implies judgment by works rather than by grace. But Scripture is clear: “We must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ” (2 Cor. 5:10), and each must “give an account” of himself to God (Rom. 14:10–12).</p>

<p>This is not salvation by works—but it is judgment according to works. Jesus Himself declared in John 5:28–29 that the hour is coming when “all who are in the tombs will hear his voice and come out, those who have done good to the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil to the resurrection of judgment.” The distinction is not that one group earned salvation and the other didn’t. Rather, one group trusted Christ and bore fruit; the other rejected Him and lived in rebellion. As James writes, “Faith without works is dead” (James 2:26).</p>

<p>Even in this judgment scene, grace shines. “Another book was opened, which is the book of life” (Rev. 20:12). This is the book Jesus alluded to in Luke 10:20 when He told His disciples to rejoice that their names were written in heaven. It is the book of those united with Christ—those who died with Him, were raised with Him (Rom. 6:8), and now live for Him.</p>

<p>The small deeds of the faithful are not forgotten. Jesus assures us in Matthew 10:42 and Mark 9:41 that even a cup of cold water given in His name will not go unrewarded. And in Matthew 6, He reminds us that “your Father who sees in secret will reward you” (Matthew 6:4, 6, 18). God watches, remembers, and will reward every act done for Christ.</p>

<p>The judgment scene reminds us that God’s justice will prevail. Every wicked deed will be exposed, every injustice rectified. We feel this deeply when we watch courtroom dramas or crime documentaries—it’s a reflection of our God-given desire for justice. But the hope for the believer is not merely that evil will be punished—it is that grace will triumph, mercy will cover, and Christ’s righteousness will stand in our place.</p>

<p>Those who are not found in the Book of Life face the second death—eternal separation from God. This is not because they failed to do enough good, but because they rejected the only One who could make them righteous. As Revelation 20:15 states, “If anyone’s name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire.”</p>

<p>So what should we do? Trust in Christ. Walk in the Spirit. Live in light of the judgment to come—not with fear, but with reverence and purpose. The day will come when we will stand before Him. Let us strive to hear the words, “Well done, good and faithful servant” (Matt. 25:23), as we bring before Him lives that bore witness to His lordship, not to earn salvation, but to honor the One who gave it.</p>

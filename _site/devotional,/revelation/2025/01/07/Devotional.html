    <blockquote>
  <p><strong>Revelation 2:2 ESV</strong>
“I know your works, your toil and your patient endurance, and how you cannot bear with those who are evil, but have tested those who call themselves apostles and are not, and found them to be false.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jesus speaks to the church in Ephesus, commending them for their diligence and discernment. They worked hard, persevered through trials, and guarded the truth of the gospel. Importantly, they did not blindly accept every teacher or doctrine that came their way. Instead, they tested those who claimed spiritual authority, exposing false apostles and rejecting their deception.</p>

<p>This reminder is crucial for us today. In a world overflowing with voices claiming to represent God, discernment is a vital part of our faith. Like the Ephesians, we must anchor ourselves in God’s Word, allowing it to be the standard by which we evaluate all teachings. This means studying Scripture, praying for wisdom, and being sensitive to the leading of the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p>Jesus’ commendation of the Ephesians’ discernment shows that He values a church that stands firm for truth. But it also challenges us to examine our own hearts. Are we diligent in guarding against falsehood? Do we seek His wisdom to navigate the complexities of modern culture?</p>

<p>Let us strive to honor Christ by remaining steadfast in truth and lovingly yet firmly rejecting what is false. May our faith be marked by both perseverance and discernment, bringing glory to the One who is the ultimate truth.</p>

  <p><strong>Revelation 2:12 ESV</strong>
“And to the angel of the church in Pergamum write: ‘The words of him who has the sharp two-edged sword.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Revelation of Jesus Christ! The wielder of the two-edged sword! This sword is the Word of God, which pierces, judges, and brings truth. (Hebrews 4:12)</p>

<p>The authority of Christ is absolute. He is the one who holds all power in heaven and earth (Matthew 28:18). His Word is not just a tool of judgment but a source of life and transformation. (Isaiah 55:11)  Christ’s sword is not wielded aimlessly; it is precise and intentional, cutting through deception and sin to reveal truth.</p>

<p>In a world often filled with confusion and compromise, Revelation 2:12 reminds us of the steadfast authority of Jesus. His Word stands unchanging, a beacon of light in darkness. As the church in Pergamum struggled with external pressures and internal struggles, Christ reminded them of His power to defend and purify His people.</p>

<p>Today, let us submit to the authority of Christ and His Word. When we face battles—whether against sin, fear, or worldly influences—let us wield the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God (Ephesians 6:17). Let us trust in its ability to guide, correct, and equip us for every good work (2 Timothy 3:16-17).</p>

<p>May we find confidence in Christ’s supreme authority and the power of His Word to shape our lives, cut away what hinders, and empower us to walk in truth.</p>

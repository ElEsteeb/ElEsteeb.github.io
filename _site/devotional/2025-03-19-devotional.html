<div class="scripture">
Revelation 11:15-19 ESV  
"Then the seventh angel blew his trumpet, and there were loud voices in heaven, saying, “The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ, and he shall reign forever and ever.” And the twenty-four elders who sit on their thrones before God fell on their faces and worshiped God, saying,
“We give thanks to you, Lord God Almighty, who is and who was, for you have taken your great power and begun to reign. The nations raged, but your wrath came, and the time for the dead to be judged, and for rewarding your servants, the prophets and saints, and those who fear your name, both small and great,
and for destroying the destroyers of the earth.” Then God's temple in heaven was opened, and the ark of his covenant was seen within his temple. There were flashes of lightning, rumblings, peals of thunder, an earthquake, and heavy hail."
</div>

<p>This glorious scene reveals the triumph of Jesus as King. The elders declare that the kingdom of this world has become the kingdom of Christ — echoing the promise of Psalm 2, where God declares of His Son, “Ask of me, and I will make the nations your heritage, and the ends of the earth your possession” (Psalm 2:8).</p>

<p>Psalm 2 also warns that the nations will rage against God’s anointed one (Psalm 2:1-3), yet despite their rebellion, Christ’s victory is sure. Revelation 11 shows that He reigns even now, working out His perfect plan. As Paul writes, “He must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet” (1 Corinthians 15:25).</p>

<p>This is cause for joy! Jesus is not waiting to take His throne — He reigns today. Though the world may seem chaotic, His kingdom is advancing. He is gathering His people, defending His church, and subduing His enemies. Nothing is outside His control.</p>

<p>The scene concludes with the temple opening to reveal the ark of the covenant — a reminder that God’s promises are secure. His covenant though hidden for a time, is now revealed! His faithfulness to His people will never fail.</p>

<p>Rejoice in this truth! Christ reigns now, and His reign will never end. Though the world rages, the King is on His throne — and nothing can stop His kingdom from filling the earth with His glory.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Revelation 6:1-2 ESV</strong>
“Now I watched when the Lamb opened one of the seven seals, and I heard one of the four living creatures say with a voice like thunder, “Come!” [2] And I looked, and behold, a white horse! And its rider had a bow, and a crown was given to him, and he came out conquering, and to conquer.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When Jesus begins opening the seals, He is not merely revealing the future—He is unveiling the will of God for all of history. The scroll, sealed until now, represents God’s divine decree, His sovereign plan that had been hidden but is now executed by the Lamb. This aligns with Hebrews 9:16-17, which explains that a will (or covenant) only takes effect after the death of the one who made it. “For where a will is involved, the death of the one who made it must be established. For a will takes effect only at death, since it is not in force as long as the one who made it is alive.” Christ, through His death, has not only secured redemption but has also activated the revealing of God’s eternal decree.</p>

<p>The first seal brings forth a rider on a white horse, a symbol of conquest. This rider does not act outside of Christ’s authority—he is sent forth as part of the divine plan. Just as no power rises or falls apart from God’s will (Daniel 2:21), so too does this conqueror ride forth under sovereign decree. The four living creatures, who proclaim “Come!” represent God’s omniscient presence in history, ensuring that all unfolds according to His perfect knowledge.</p>

<p>What awe this should inspire in us! Christ is not a passive observer; He holds the scroll and commands history itself. His death did not merely save—it also inaugurated the revelation of God’s will. As the seals are broken, we are reminded that nothing in this world, no ruler, no kingdom, and no event, is beyond the authority of the risen Lamb. “The LORD has established his throne in the heavens, and his kingdom rules over all” (Psalm 103:19). Let us live with confidence, knowing that the same Lamb who redeemed us is the One guiding all of history in His perfect plan.</p>

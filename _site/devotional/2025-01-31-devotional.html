<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Revelation 3:20-22 ESV</strong>
‚ÄúBehold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and eat with him, and he with me. [21] The one who conquers, I will grant him to sit with me on my throne, as I also conquered and sat down with my Father on his throne. [22] He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.‚Äô‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These words from Jesus are often used in evangelism, but they were spoken to the church in Laodicea. This wasn‚Äôt a call to salvation but an invitation to renewed fellowship. The Laodiceans had become lukewarm‚Äîneither hot nor cold‚Äîself-satisfied and unaware of their spiritual poverty (Revelation 3:15-17). Yet, Jesus had not abandoned them. Instead, He stood outside, knocking, desiring to be welcomed back into intimate communion with His people.</p>

<p>The imagery of Jesus dining with His followers speaks of deep, personal fellowship. In ancient culture, sharing a meal was an act of closeness and trust. This is what Christ longs for with His church‚Äînot distant acknowledgment but a vibrant, daily relationship. His knocking is persistent, His invitation open.</p>

<p>For those who heed His voice, Jesus promises victory. The one who conquers‚Äîwho resists spiritual complacency and embraces renewed fellowship‚Äîwill reign with Him. This is a call to the church today as much as it was to Laodicea. If you have found yourself distant from Christ, distracted by self-sufficiency or worldly concerns, He is near. Open the door, let Him in, and enjoy the fullness of His presence once more!</p>

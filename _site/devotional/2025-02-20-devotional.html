<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Revelation 6:7-8 ESV</strong>
“When he opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature say, “Come!” [8] And I looked, and behold, a pale horse! And its rider’s name was Death, and Hades followed him. And they were given authority over a fourth of the earth, to kill with sword and with famine and with pestilence and by wild beasts of the earth.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The shadow of death looms over all of human history. Every day, we hear news of wars, plagues, famines, and tragedies. Even those close to us succumb inevitably to that shadow. Fear grips the hearts of many, but for those in Christ, there is an unshakable truth: Jesus reigns even over death itself.</p>

<p>The pale horse is terrifying. Its rider, Death, is followed by Hades, gathering the souls of the fallen. Yet, notice the key phrase: “they were given authority.” Death does not rule by its own power; it operates only under the limits Christ has set. It is the Lamb that is opening the seals that reveal God’s will. Just as Daniel 4:35 declares, “He does according to his will among the host of heaven and among the inhabitants of the earth,” even the most dreadful forces in history bow before the Lamb.</p>

<p>This is where the glory of Christ shines most brightly. He is not only sovereign over judgment—He is the Savior who rescues His people from it. Romans 9:22-23 reminds us that God endures vessels of wrath in order to display the riches of His mercy toward His chosen ones. Even in allowing suffering and death, Christ magnifies His love by redeeming those who are His. He took on flesh, bore our sins, and conquered the grave so that Death and Hades would have no hold on us (Revelation 1:18).</p>

<p>So do not fear! The world may seem overcome by chaos, but Christ is on the throne. Calling to our hearts, “Peace, be still.” The Lamb who was slain is the same Lamb who reigns. The one who permits Death’s advance is the same one who swallowed up death in victory (1 Corinthians 15:54-57). One day, He will cast Death and Hades into the lake of fire (Revelation 20:14), and His people will reign with Him forever. Until then, we walk in faith, knowing that nothing—neither death nor life—can separate us from His love (Romans 8:38-39).</p>

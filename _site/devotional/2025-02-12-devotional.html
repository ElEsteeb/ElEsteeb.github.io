<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Revelation 5:6 (ESV)</strong>
‚ÄúAnd between the throne and the four living creatures and among the elders I saw a Lamb standing, as though it had been slain, with seven horns and with seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent out into all the earth.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The vision of Christ in Revelation 5:6 presents a paradox‚ÄîJesus is both the conquering Lion and the slain Lamb. In Revelation 5:5, He is called the ‚ÄúLion of the tribe of Judah‚Äù who has triumphed, yet He appears as a Lamb that was slain. This is the mystery of His victory: through His suffering, He overcame the power of sin and death (Isaiah 53:5). His seven horns symbolize perfect power (Daniel 7:14), and His seven eyes represent divine omniscience, the fullness of the Spirit sent throughout the earth (Zechariah 4:10). Though the world rejected Him (John 1:11), He now stands alive, reigning at the right hand of God (Hebrews 1:3).</p>

<p>This passage reminds us that true victory comes through apparent weakness. Jesus conquered not by force, but by surrendering to the will of the Father (Philippians 2:8). His wounds testify to His love (John 15:13), His scars declare His authority (John 20:27-28), and His resurrection proclaims His eternal reign (Romans 6:9). Because He has overcome, we can take heart in our trials (John 16:33), knowing that our struggles are not meaningless but are producing an eternal glory (2 Corinthians 4:17).</p>

<p>In a world obsessed with strength and self-sufficiency, this vision calls us to a different kind of power‚Äîthe power of surrender to God‚Äôs perfect will (2 Corinthians 12:9-10). Just as Jesus‚Äô sacrifice ushered in His greatest glory (Hebrews 12:2), our faithfulness in trials will be met with eternal reward (James 1:12). The Lamb reigns, and because He does, we have unshakable hope (1 Peter 1:3-4).</p>

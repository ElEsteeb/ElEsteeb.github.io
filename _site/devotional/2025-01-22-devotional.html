  <blockquote>
  <p><strong>Revelation 3:2-3 ESV</strong>
“Wake up, and strengthen what remains and is about to die, for I have not found your works complete in the sight of my God. [3] Remember, then, what you received and heard. Keep it, and repent. If you will not wake up, I will come like a thief, and you will not know at what hour I will come against you.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The message to the church in Sardis is a sobering reminder of the danger of spiritual complacency. Though they had a reputation for being alive, their deeds revealed a different reality (Revelation 3:1). Christ’s command to “wake up” calls us to spiritual vigilance. Just as Sardis needed to revive their dying faith, we too must evaluate the state of our hearts and our obedience to God’s Word (James 1:22-25).</p>

<p>Jesus also urges them to “strengthen what remains.” Even in their weakened state, hope was not lost. This echoes the encouragement found in Isaiah 42:3, where God promises not to break a bruised reed or quench a faintly burning wick. No matter how dim our faith may feel, God is ready to strengthen and restore us when we humbly seek Him.</p>

<p>The call to “remember” points us back to the foundation of the gospel. Like the church in Ephesus, Sardis had forgotten their first love (Revelation 2:4-5). To persevere, we must continually meditate on and live out what we have received through Christ—His life, death, and resurrection (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Repentance is key; it is not a one-time act but an ongoing turning back to God in faith and obedience (Acts 3:19).</p>

<p>Finally, the warning that Christ will come “like a thief” urges us to live with readiness (1 Thessalonians 5:2-6). His return will be sudden and unexpected, making it crucial to remain steadfast and watchful, whether we get to see his return, or he calls us home before. Let us heed this call, not allowing our faith to grow cold but actively pursuing lives that glorify Him (Hebrews 10:23-25).</p>

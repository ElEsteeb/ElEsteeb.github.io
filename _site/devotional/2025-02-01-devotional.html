<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Revelation 3:21-22 ESV</strong>
‚Äú‚ÄòThe one who conquers, I will grant him to sit with me on my throne, as I also conquered and sat down with my Father on his throne. [22] He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.‚Äô‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The promise of Christ to the one who conquers is staggering‚ÄîHe invites us to sit with Him on His throne. This is not mere symbolism; it reflects a profound reality of our union with Christ. Paul echoes this in Ephesians 2:6, saying that God ‚Äúraised us up with him and seated us with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus.‚Äù Our destiny is not just to be saved but to reign with Him, sharing in His authority and victory.</p>

<p>Hebrews 1:3 tells us that after Christ ‚Äúmade purification for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high.‚Äù His enthronement signifies His finished work and absolute rule. Yet, in His grace, He extends this reign to those who persevere in faith. We do not strive for victory; we stand in the victory He has already won. To conquer is not about personal strength but about remaining faithful to Him who has already overcome (John 16:33).</p>

<p>This promise calls us to a mindset shift. If we are seated with Christ, then our perspective must be heavenly, not earthly. The trials we face are temporary, but our position in Him is eternal (2 Corinthians 4:17-18). When the struggles of this world press in, we must remember that we are not merely enduring; we are ruling with Christ, even now, by living in His power and authority. The Spirit calls us to listen‚Äîto truly grasp the weight of this promise and walk in it with confidence.</p>

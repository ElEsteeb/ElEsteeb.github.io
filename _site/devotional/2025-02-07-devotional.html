<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Revelation 4:6-8 ESV</strong>
“and before the throne there was as it were a sea of glass, like crystal. And around the throne, on each side of the throne, are four living creatures, full of eyes in front and behind: the first living creature like a lion, the second living creature like an ox, the third living creature with the face of a man, and the fourth living creature like an eagle in flight. And the four living creatures, each of them with six wings, are full of eyes all around and within, and day and night they never cease to say, “Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord God Almighty, who was and is and is to come!”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>John’s vision of God’s throne reveals the overwhelming majesty of the Lord. The sea of glass reflects the purity and transcendence of His presence, much like the pavement of sapphire seen by Moses and the elders in Exodus 24:10. God’s throne is not surrounded by chaos, as the sea often represents in Scripture (Psalm 93:3-4), but by stillness, emphasizing His absolute authority and perfect order. Before such a throne, there is no room for disorder—only awe and worship.</p>

<p>The four living creatures represent the fullness of creation giving praise to God. Their appearances—a lion, an ox, a man, and an eagle—reflect strength, service, wisdom, and majesty, encompassing all aspects of life under God’s rule (Ezekiel 1:10). Their many eyes symbolize God’s perfect knowledge, seeing all things (2 Chronicles 16:9). Nothing escapes His gaze, and nothing in creation exists outside His sovereignty.</p>

<p>These creatures do not rest but declare, “Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord God Almighty”. This threefold declaration of God’s holiness echoes Isaiah 6:3, reinforcing that He is set apart, beyond comparison, and eternally perfect. Worship in heaven is unceasing because God’s holiness is infinite. As we meditate on this vision, we are reminded that our lives should also be marked by worship, recognizing that the One who was, who is, and who is to come reigns forever.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Revelation 5:11-12 ESV</strong>
‚ÄúThen I looked, and I heard around the throne and the living creatures and the elders the voice of many angels, numbering myriads of myriads and thousands of thousands, [12] saying with a loud voice, ‚ÄúWorthy is the Lamb who was slain, to receive power and wealth and wisdom and might and honor and glory and blessing!‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unimaginable majesty. The Lamb, slain yet standing, is at the center of heaven‚Äôs worship. The voices of countless angels erupt in praise, declaring His worthiness, joining the elders and living creatures. This is no ordinary acclamation‚Äîit is a cosmic recognition of Christ‚Äôs supremacy. His sacrifice on the cross (John 1:29) has not only redeemed His people but has secured His exaltation. God has highly exalted Him and bestowed on Him the name above every name, that every knee should bow and every tongue confess that He is Lord. (Philippians 2:9-11)</p>

<p>The sevenfold declaration‚Äîpower, wealth, wisdom, might, honor, glory, and blessing‚Äîreflects the completeness of Christ‚Äôs worth. Unlike earthly rulers who seize power, Jesus receives it because of His obedience and atoning work (Hebrews 2:9). He is the fulfillment of Isaiah 53:5, the Lamb who was wounded for our transgressions. His worth is not measured by human standards but by the divine decree of the Father, who has placed all things under His feet (Ephesians 1:22).</p>

<p>This passage reminds us that worship is the only right response to Christ‚Äôs sacrifice. If the heavenly host proclaims His worth, how much more should we? As Romans 12:1 urges, we are to present our bodies as living sacrifices, holy and acceptable to God, which is our spiritual worship. The Lamb who was slain is now the reigning King, let our lives reflect the anthem of heaven: Worthy is the Lamb!</p>

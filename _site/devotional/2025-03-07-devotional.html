<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Revelation 8:12 (ESV)</strong>
“The fourth angel blew his trumpet, and a third of the sun was struck, and a third of the moon, and a third of the stars, so that a third of their light might be darkened, and a third of the day might be kept from shining, and likewise a third of the night.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Throughout history, the rise and fall of nations have been marked by celestial imagery. Governments and empires have used suns, moons, and stars as symbols of their power—seen even today in the flags of the world. Scripture uses this imagery as well. We see it in the judgment of earthly rulers and the supremacy of Christ’s kingdom. In Isaiah 13:10 and Ezekiel 32:7-8, the darkening of the sun, moon, and stars signifies the fall of mighty nations. In Revelation 8:12, we see this same language applied to Jerusalem. The old order was passing away. The rulers of Israel—the Sanhedrin, the priests, the Herodian dynasty—would be cast down. Their system, which had rejected the Messiah, was being removed.</p>

<p>Jesus foretold this in Matthew 24:29, saying, “Immediately after the tribulation of those days the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, and the stars will fall from heaven.” The destruction of Jerusalem in 70 A.D. was not just a military event; it was divine judgment. The light of the old covenant had faded, and the earthly kingdom of Israel was no more. But while Jerusalem’s lights were darkened, Christ’s kingdom shone all the brighter.</p>

<p>Jesus declared in John 8:12, “I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.” Earthly kingdoms rise and fall. Their symbols may endure on flags, but their power fades. Yet the kingdom of Christ is everlasting. His rule is not dependent on earthly governments, for His kingdom is not of this world (John 18:36). The judgment that fell on Jerusalem was not the end of God’s people—it was the beginning of a kingdom that cannot be shaken (Hebrews 12:28).</p>

<p>As we witness the uncertainty of nations today, we must remember where our true citizenship lies. The world’s rulers will fail. Their empires will darken. But the kingdom of Christ remains forever. “The Lord will be your everlasting light, and your God will be your glory.” (Isaiah 60:19) Let us set our hope on what cannot be destroyed. The light of Christ’s reign will never fade.</p>

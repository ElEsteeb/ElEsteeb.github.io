  <blockquote>
  <p><strong>Revelation 2:13 ESV</strong>
‚Äú‚ÄòI know where you dwell, where Satan‚Äôs throne is. Yet you hold fast my name, and you did not deny my faith even in the days of Antipas my faithful witness, who was killed among you, where Satan dwells.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The words of Christ to the church in Pergamum are both comforting and convicting. ‚ÄúI know where you dwell.‚Äù This declaration reminds us that no detail of our lives escapes His notice. Just as He was aware of the challenges faced by the believers in Pergamum, He knows the pressures, temptations, and trials we encounter daily (Psalm 139:1‚Äì4). Whether we live in a culture hostile to faith or face personal struggles, we can take comfort in knowing that Christ is fully aware of our circumstances.</p>

<p>This divine knowledge is not passive but active and empathetic. (Hebrews 4:15) Jesus does not merely observe our lives from afar; He walks with us, offering strength and encouragement (Matthew 28:20).</p>

<p>The believers in Pergamum were commended for their steadfastness: ‚ÄúYet you hold fast‚Äù Despite living in a city dominated by pagan worship and intense opposition, they remained loyal to Christ. Their example challenges us to examine our own faithfulness. Do we hold fast to Christ‚Äôs name in our workplaces, schools, or communities, even when it is costly?</p>

<p>Jesus specifically mentions Antipas, ‚Äúmy faithful witness,‚Äù who was martyred. The faithfulness of Antipas and the church in Pergamum echoes the call in Revelation 12:11.  Such faithfulness, even in the face of persecution, brings glory to God and advances His kingdom.</p>

<p>Jesus‚Äô words to the church in Pergamum remind us that our faithfulness does not go unnoticed. He sees and honors those who remain steadfast, just as He commended the church for not denying His name. (Galatians 6:9) Our trials are not in vain; Christ acknowledges and rewards the perseverance of His people.</p>

<p>Let us be encouraged by the knowledge that Christ sees our struggles and is with us in the midst of them. Let us resolve to hold fast to His name and remain faithful, even when the culture around us opposes Him.</p>

<p>-steve</p>

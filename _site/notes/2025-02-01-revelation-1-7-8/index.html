Even so. Amen. 8 “I am the Alpha and the Omega,” says the Lord God, “who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty.”” Greek Language Solecisms The Greek text of Revelation is known for its Semitic influence and occasional grammatical irregularities. In Revelation 1:7-8: ἔρχεται (present tense): The phrase “ἔρχεται μετὰ τῶν νεφελῶν” (“he is coming with the clouds”) uses the present tense (ἔρχεται) rather than the future (ἐλεύσεται) to emphasize the certainty of Christ’s coming. While not a solecism, this is a stylistic choice reflecting prophetic immediacy. πᾶς ὀφθαλμὸς αὐτὸν ὄψεται: The accusative pronoun “αὐτὸν” (him) is used with the future middle verb “ὄψεται” (“will see”), which typically takes the accusative for the object seen. However, the phrase “every eye” (nominative: πᾶς ὀφθαλμός) is followed by “αὐτὸν” (accusative), which some argue is awkward. This may reflect John’s Semitic syntax (cf. Zechariah 12:10 LXX). ὁ πρικήσας: The aorist participle “ὁ πρικήσας” (“those who pierced”) lacks an explicit subject, but contextually refers to Israel (cf. John 19:37) and/or humanity collectively. No solecism here, but the phrase assumes prior knowledge of Jesus’ crucifixion. Overall, the passage’s grammar is unconventional but intentional, reflecting John’s apocalyptic style and theological emphasis. Key Scriptural Cross-References Daniel 7:13-14: “One like a son of man” coming with clouds. Zechariah 12:10: Mourning for “him whom they have pierced.” Matthew 24:30: Christ’s return with power and great glory. Luke 21:20-24: Jesus’ prophecy of Jerusalem’s destruction. John 19:37: Fulfillment of Zechariah 12:10 in Christ’s crucifixion. Acts 1:9-11: Jesus’ ascension and promised return. Revelation 20:11-15: Final judgment after the millennial age. Interpretations Through Eschatological Lenses 1. Amillennialism View: Christ’s reign is spiritual and present (Rev. 20:1-6 is symbolic). His “coming” (v. 7) is a single, final event coinciding with judgment and the eternal state. Explanation: “Coming with the clouds” (v. 7) echoes Daniel 7:13-14 and Matthew 24:30, emphasizing Christ’s divine authority and final victory. “All tribes will wail” (v. 7) signifies universal recognition of guilt at His return (Zechariah 12:10-14). “Alpha and Omega” (v. 8) stresses God’s sovereignty over all history, denying a literal millennial kingdom. Theologians: Augustine (City of God), G.K. Beale (Revelation: A Shorter Commentary), Anthony Hoekema (The Bible and the Future). 2. Historic Premillennialism View: Christ returns before (pre-) a literal millennium (Rev. 20:4-6), inaugurated after tribulation. Explanation: “Coming with the clouds” (v. 7) is a physical return to establish His kingdom on earth (Acts 1:11; 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17). “Those who pierced him” (v. 7) includes both Jews (Zechariah 12:10) and Gentiles (Romans 11:25-26) who reject Him. The “Almighty” (v. 8) will judge evil and inaugurate His millennial reign. Theologians: George Eldon Ladd (A Commentary on the Revelation of John), John Calvin (modified premillennial leanings), N.T. Wright (Surprised by Hope). 3. Dispensational Premillennialism View: Christ returns after a seven-year tribulation to establish a literal 1,000-year kingdom, with Israel restored nationally (Rev. 20:1-7). Explanation: “Every eye will see him” (v. 7) includes a literal, global visibility at the Second Coming (cf. 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17; Zechariah 14:4). “All tribes will wail” (v. 7) refers to unbelieving nations mourning their defeat (Matthew 24:30). “Alpha and Omega” (v. 8) affirms Christ’s eternal deity and role in fulfilling covenants (e.g., Abrahamic, Davidic). Theologians: John Walvoord (The Revelation of Jesus Christ), Charles Ryrie (Dispensationalism Today), Tim LaHaye (Left Behind series). 4. Postmillennialism View: Christ returns after (post-) a golden age of gospel triumph (the “millennium” as a long period of Christian dominance). Explanation: “Coming with the clouds” (v. 7) is a future event following gradual global conversion (Matthew 28:18-20; Psalm 110:1). “All tribes will wail” (v. 7) describes residual opposition finally judged at Christ’s return. “Who is to come” (v. 8) implies God’s plan unfolds progressively through history, culminating in victory. Theologians: Jonathan Edwards (History of Redemption), R.J. Rushdoony (Thy Kingdom Come), Greg Bahnsen (Victory in Jesus). 5. Partial-Preterist Postmillennialism View: This framework synthesizes partial preterism (many prophecies were fulfilled in the first century, e.g., the destruction of Jerusalem in AD 70) with postmillennial optimism (the gospel will gradually triumph, leading to a golden age before Christ’s final return). Revelation 1:7-8 is seen as having dual fulfillment: judgment on Israel (AD 70) and a future, global consummation. Explanation “Behold, he is coming with the clouds” (v. 7): Partial-preterists connect this to Christ’s judgment on Jerusalem in AD 70, fulfilling Daniel 7:13-14 (“Son of Man” receiving dominion) and Matthew 24:30 (judgment “within this generation”; Matt. 24:34). The “clouds” symbolize divine judgment (cf. Isaiah 19:1; Ezekiel 30:3), not literal clouds. Postmillennialists also anticipate a future, literal return after the gospel’s global triumph (Psalm 110:1; 1 Corinthians 15:24-28). “Those who pierced him” (v. 7): Refers primarily to Jewish leaders and generations complicit in Jesus’ crucifixion (John 19:37; Zechariah 12:10). Their judgment occurred in AD 70 (Luke 21:20-24), fulfilling Jesus’ warning (Matt. 23:36-38). Yet, the mourning of “all tribes” (v. 7) also anticipates final accountability for all nations at Christ’s ultimate return (Revelation 20:11-15). “Alpha and Omega” (v. 8)**: Emphasizes God’s sovereignty over all history, including past judgments (AD 70) and the future culmination of His kingdom. The title “Almighty” (παντοκράτωρ) underscores His power to orchestrate history toward gospel victory (Matthew 28:18-20; Romans 11:25-26). Synthesis: The partial-preterist postmillennial view distinguishes between already-fulfilled judgment (e.g., AD 70) and not-yet-fulfilled consummation. Revelation 1:7-8 bridges these: Christ’s judicial “coming” in history (v. 7) prefigures His final return (v. 8), ensuring God’s plan unfolds through gospel triumph, judgment on rebellion, and ultimate restoration. This lens harmonizes the urgency of first-century prophecy with long-term optimism for Christ’s reign. Theologians: Kenneth Gentry (He Shall Have Dominion), R.C. Sproul (The Last Days According to Jesus), David Chilton (Days of Vengeance). Key Takeaway Each eschatological framework prioritizes different aspects of these texts, but all affirm Christ’s ultimate victory and divine identity. Bibliography 1.

<p><strong>Text (ESV):</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>“Behold, he is coming with the clouds, and every eye will see him, even those who pierced him, and all tribes of the earth will wail on account of him. Even so. Amen. 8 “I am the Alpha and the Omega,” says the Lord God, “who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty.””</em></p>

<h3 id="greek-language-solecisms"><strong>Greek Language Solecisms</strong></h3>
<p>The Greek text of Revelation is known for its Semitic influence and occasional grammatical irregularities. In Revelation 1:7-8:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>ἔρχεται (present tense)</strong>: The phrase “ἔρχεται μετὰ τῶν νεφελῶν” (“he is coming with the clouds”) uses the present tense (ἔρχεται) rather than the future (ἐλεύσεται) to emphasize the certainty of Christ’s coming. While not a solecism, this is a stylistic choice reflecting prophetic immediacy.</li>
  <li><strong>πᾶς ὀφθαλμὸς αὐτὸν ὄψεται</strong>: The accusative pronoun “αὐτὸν” (him) is used with the future middle verb “ὄψεται” (“will see”), which typically takes the accusative for the object seen. However, the phrase “every eye” (nominative: πᾶς ὀφθαλμός) is followed by “αὐτὸν” (accusative), which some argue is awkward. This may reflect John’s Semitic syntax (cf. Zechariah 12:10 LXX).</li>
  <li><strong>ὁ πρικήσας</strong>: The aorist participle “ὁ πρικήσας” (“those who pierced”) lacks an explicit subject, but contextually refers to Israel (cf. John 19:37) and/or humanity collectively. No solecism here, but the phrase assumes prior knowledge of Jesus’ crucifixion.</li>
</ol>

<p>Overall, the passage’s grammar is unconventional but intentional, reflecting John’s apocalyptic style and theological emphasis.</p>

<h3 id="interpretations-through-eschatological-lenses"><strong>Interpretations Through Eschatological Lenses</strong></h3>

<h4 id="1-amillennialism"><strong>1. Amillennialism</strong></h4>
<p><strong>View</strong>: Christ’s reign is spiritual and present (Rev. 20:1-6 is symbolic). His “coming” (v. 7) is a single, final event coinciding with judgment and the eternal state.<br />
<strong>Explanation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>“Coming with the clouds” (v. 7) echoes Daniel 7:13-14 and Matthew 24:30, emphasizing Christ’s divine authority and final victory.</li>
  <li>“All tribes will wail” (v. 7) signifies universal recognition of guilt at His return (Zechariah 12:10-14).</li>
  <li>“Alpha and Omega” (v. 8) stresses God’s sovereignty over all history, denying a literal millennial kingdom.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Theologians</strong>: Augustine (<em>City of God</em>), G.K. Beale (<em>Revelation: A Shorter Commentary</em>), Anthony Hoekema (<em>The Bible and the Future</em>).</p>

<h4 id="2-historic-premillennialism"><strong>2. Historic Premillennialism</strong></h4>
<p><strong>View</strong>: Christ returns <em>before</em> (pre-) a literal millennium (Rev. 20:4-6), inaugurated after tribulation.<br />
<strong>Explanation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>“Coming with the clouds” (v. 7) is a physical return to establish His kingdom on earth (Acts 1:11; 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17).</li>
  <li>“Those who pierced him” (v. 7) includes both Jews (Zechariah 12:10) and Gentiles (Romans 11:25-26) who reject Him.</li>
  <li>The “Almighty” (v. 8) will judge evil and inaugurate His millennial reign.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Theologians</strong>: George Eldon Ladd (<em>A Commentary on the Revelation of John</em>), John Calvin (modified premillennial leanings), N.T. Wright (<em>Surprised by Hope</em>).</p>

<h4 id="3-dispensational-premillennialism"><strong>3. Dispensational Premillennialism</strong></h4>
<p><strong>View</strong>: Christ returns <em>after</em> a seven-year tribulation to establish a literal 1,000-year kingdom, with Israel restored nationally (Rev. 20:1-7).<br />
<strong>Explanation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>“Every eye will see him” (v. 7) includes a literal, global visibility at the Second Coming (cf. 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17; Zechariah 14:4).</li>
  <li>“All tribes will wail” (v. 7) refers to unbelieving nations mourning their defeat (Matthew 24:30).</li>
  <li>“Alpha and Omega” (v. 8) affirms Christ’s eternal deity and role in fulfilling covenants (e.g., Abrahamic, Davidic).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Theologians</strong>: John Walvoord (<em>The Revelation of Jesus Christ</em>), Charles Ryrie (<em>Dispensationalism Today</em>), Tim LaHaye (<em>Left Behind</em> series).</p>

<h4 id="4-postmillennialism"><strong>4. Postmillennialism</strong></h4>
<p><strong>View</strong>: Christ returns <em>after</em> (post-) a golden age of gospel triumph (the “millennium” as a long period of Christian dominance).<br />
<strong>Explanation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>“Coming with the clouds” (v. 7) is a future event following gradual global conversion (Matthew 28:18-20; Psalm 110:1).</li>
  <li>“All tribes will wail” (v. 7) describes residual opposition finally judged at Christ’s return.</li>
  <li>“Who is to come” (v. 8) implies God’s plan unfolds progressively through history, culminating in victory.<br />
<strong>Theologians</strong>: Jonathan Edwards (<em>History of Redemption</em>), R.J. Rushdoony (<em>Thy Kingdom Come</em>), Greg Bahnsen (<em>Victory in Jesus</em>).</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="5-partial-preterist-postmillennialism"><strong>5. Partial-Preterist Postmillennialism</strong></h4>

<p><strong>View</strong>: This framework synthesizes <strong>partial preterism</strong> (many prophecies were fulfilled in the first century, e.g., the destruction of Jerusalem in AD 70) with <strong>postmillennial optimism</strong> (the gospel will gradually triumph, leading to a golden age before Christ’s final return). Revelation 1:7-8 is seen as having dual fulfillment: judgment on Israel (AD 70) and a future, global consummation.<br />
<strong>Explanation</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>“Behold, he is coming with the clouds” (v. 7):
    <ul>
      <li>Partial-preterists connect this to Christ’s <em>judgment on Jerusalem</em> in AD 70, fulfilling Daniel 7:13-14 (“Son of Man” receiving dominion) and Matthew 24:30 (judgment “within this generation”; Matt. 24:34). The “clouds” symbolize divine judgment (cf. Isaiah 19:1; Ezekiel 30:3), not literal clouds.</li>
      <li>Postmillennialists also anticipate a <em>future, literal return</em> after the gospel’s global triumph (Psalm 110:1; 1 Corinthians 15:24-28).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>“Those who pierced him” (v. 7):
    <ul>
      <li>Refers primarily to <em>Jewish leaders and generations</em> complicit in Jesus’ crucifixion (John 19:37; Zechariah 12:10). Their judgment occurred in AD 70 (Luke 21:20-24), fulfilling Jesus’ warning (Matt. 23:36-38).</li>
      <li>Yet, the mourning of “all tribes” (v. 7) also anticipates <em>final accountability</em> for all nations at Christ’s ultimate return (Revelation 20:11-15).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>“Alpha and Omega” (v. 8)**:
    <ul>
      <li>Emphasizes God’s sovereignty over <em>all history</em>, including past judgments (AD 70) and the future culmination of His kingdom. The title “Almighty” (παντοκράτωρ) underscores His power to orchestrate history toward gospel victory (Matthew 28:18-20; Romans 11:25-26).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Synthesis</strong>: The partial-preterist postmillennial view distinguishes between <em>already-fulfilled judgment</em> (e.g., AD 70) and <em>not-yet-fulfilled consummation</em>. Revelation 1:7-8 bridges these: Christ’s judicial “coming” in history (v. 7) prefigures His final return (v. 8), ensuring God’s plan unfolds through gospel triumph, judgment on rebellion, and ultimate restoration. This lens harmonizes the urgency of first-century prophecy with long-term optimism for Christ’s reign.</p>

<p><strong>Theologians</strong>: Kenneth Gentry (<em>He Shall Have Dominion</em>), R.C. Sproul (<em>The Last Days According to Jesus</em>), David Chilton (<em>Days of Vengeance</em>).</p>

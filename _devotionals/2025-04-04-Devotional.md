<div class="scripture">
  "Then I heard a loud voice from the temple telling the seven angels, "Go and pour out on the earth the seven bowls of the wrath of God." So the first angel went and poured out his bowl on the earth, and harmful and painful sores came upon the people who bore the mark of the beast and worshiped its image." (Revelation 16:1-2, ESV)
</div>

As the first bowl of judgment is poured out, we see a striking parallel to the plagues of Egypt, particularly the sixth plague where boils afflicted the Egyptians (Exodus 9:8-12). This judgment also recalls the first trumpet in Revelation 8:7, where fire and hail turn a third of the earth to ash. Now, what was once concealed beneath the surface—hidden corruption—begins to manifest visibly. The sores symbolize a spiritual disease that has long been festering within those who follow the beast, finally revealing itself in undeniable affliction.

Revelation 8:3-5 reminds us that the judgments unfolding in this book are in response to the prayers of the saints. Just as the incense in the heavenly temple ascends before God, the cries of God’s people for justice are heard. The army of the Lord, who once stood by the "fiery sea" in Revelation 15:2, is now advancing, not with swords of steel but with the sword of the Spirit (Ephesians 6:17)—the Word of God. This moment is a new Exodus, but this time it is not a departure from physical Egypt, but from spiritual Egypt—Jerusalem in rebellion (Revelation 11:8). The kingdom of God moves forward, and in doing so, it exposes the corruption of the world system.

Sores do not appear instantly; they are the culmination of disease that has already taken root. Likewise, as the Gospel advances, the true nature of the world’s rebellion against God is laid bare. The world presents itself as enlightened, progressive, and free, but under the light of truth, it is revealed as a system of decay, deception, and death. As John 3:19-20 says, "And this is the judgment: the light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the light because their works were evil. For everyone who does wicked things hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his works should be exposed."

We are called to be bearers of this light, not to destroy but to expose, to reveal the truth, and to call people to repentance before the sores of sin consume them. The world's beauty is only skin deep—beneath it lies the corruption of a system that opposes God. But as His people proclaim the Gospel, the truth is made manifest. Let us stand firm in advancing His kingdom, knowing that even as judgment is revealed, the mercy of Christ remains available to those who will turn and believe.

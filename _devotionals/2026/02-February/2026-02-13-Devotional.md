  “Love is patient and kind; love does not envy or boast; it is not arrogant or rude. It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful; it does not rejoice at wrongdoing, but rejoices with the truth.” (1 Corinthians 13:4–6, ESV)
</div> 

In 1 Corinthians 13:4–6, Paul is not giving us a list of personality traits or describing emotional warmth. He is describing the ethical character of someone who is rightly aligned with God. Biblical love is not mere affection or niceness. It is the lived expression of truth and righteousness in relationship.
Love is patient and kind because love refuses to make self the center. When our desires are no longer the highest authority, envy, boasting, arrogance, and rudeness lose their foundation. These attitudes are all forms of self-exaltation. But love reflects the character of God, who calls His people to walk humbly, do justice, and love mercy (Micah 6:8). Love is not weakness; it is strength under moral control.
Yet love is not passive. Love does not insist on its own way, but it also does not collapse into irritability or resentment. Love is emotionally disciplined because it is morally anchored. Jesus taught, “If you love me, you will keep my commandments” (John 14:15). Likewise, Scripture teaches that loving God means obeying Him (1 John 5:3). Love is not defined by how strongly we feel, but by how faithfully we live.
Because God is Creator and Lord, love cannot celebrate what God calls sin. Love does not rejoice at wrongdoing. Instead, love rejoices with the truth. Scripture consistently joins love and truth together (Psalm 85:10; 2 John 1:1–3). True love desires what is real, holy, and life-giving.
This is why love is the governing ethic of spiritual maturity. Spiritual power, knowledge, or gifting does not prove maturity. Rightly ordered love does. When the Spirit produces fruit in us, love is first (Galatians 5:22). Love is the clearest evidence that our lives are aligned with God and rightly ordered toward others.

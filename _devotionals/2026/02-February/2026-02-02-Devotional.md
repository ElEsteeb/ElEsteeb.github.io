<div class="scripture">
  “Now concerning spiritual gifts, brothers, I do not want you to be uninformed. You know that when you were pagans you were led astray to mute idols, however you were led. Therefore I want you to understand that no one speaking in the Spirit of God ever says “Jesus is accursed!” and no one can say “Jesus is Lord” except in the Holy Spirit.” (1 Corinthians 12:1–3, ESV)

Paul begins his teaching on spiritual gifts with a warning. Before he explains how the Spirit works in the church, he reminds believers that not everything that appears spiritual is from God. The Corinthians had once been “led astray to mute idols” (1 Corinthians 12:2, ESV). Their past proved something important: spiritual intensity, emotion, or supernatural appearance is not proof of spiritual truth.

The test, Paul says, is Christ Himself. “No one speaking in the Spirit of God ever says ‘Jesus is accursed!’ and no one can say ‘Jesus is Lord’ except in the Holy Spirit” (1 Corinthians 12:3). The Holy Spirit always exalts Jesus Christ as Lord. He does not glorify personalities, movements, experiences, or influence. He glorifies Christ.

This is the same warning given throughout Scripture. God warned Israel that even if signs and wonders occurred, if they led people away from Him, they were false (Deuteronomy 13:1–3). John later commands believers, “do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God” (1 John 4:1). Jesus Himself warns that many will perform miracles in His name yet not belong to Him (Matthew 7:21–23).

This matters deeply today. Many people, groups, musicians, politicians, and even brands will label themselves Christian. But labels are not the test. Influence is not the test. Emotional impact is not the test. The test is this: Is Jesus Christ being proclaimed as Lord? Is His authority being honored? Is His Word being obeyed?

We must not substitute amazement for truth. The Holy Spirit’s mission is not to impress us, but to conform us to Christ and lead us into joyful submission to Him (John 16:13–14; Philippians 2:9–11). The Spirit does not become the center of experiences, personalities, or movements. He testifies to Christ, exalts Christ, and forms Christ in His people.

Discernment is not cynicism. It is faithfulness. If we chase what dazzles instead of what is true, we risk being led astray. But if we hold fast to Christ as Lord, we will not be deceived.

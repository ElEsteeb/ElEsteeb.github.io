  “Now there are varieties of gifts, but the same Spirit; and there are varieties of service, but the same Lord; and there are varieties of activities, but it is the same God who empowers them all in everyone. To each is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the common good.” (1 Corinthians 12:4–7, ESV)
</div> 

In 1 Corinthians 12:4–7, Paul continues confronting the divisions inside the Corinthian church by reminding them of a foundational truth: every spiritual gift comes from the same God. “Now there are varieties of gifts, but the same Spirit… varieties of service, but the same Lord… varieties of activities, but it is the same God who empowers them all in everyone” (1 Cor 12:4–6, ESV).

The Corinthians were drifting into spiritual competition. Some gifts were treated as marks of superiority, while others were treated as lesser. Paul dismantles that thinking by pointing to the Trinity Himself. The Spirit gives the gifts, the Lord directs the service, and God empowers the results. If the source is God, then boasting is irrational. As James reminds us, “Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above” (James 1:17).

Paul then gives the purpose of spiritual gifts with surgical clarity: “To each is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the common good” (1 Cor 12:7). Spiritual gifts are not given for status, recognition, or influence. They are given so the body of Christ is strengthened, unified, and directed toward Him.

This reflects the broader pattern of Scripture. God has always empowered His people by His Spirit for the benefit of His people. The Spirit filled Bezalel with skill to build the tabernacle for Israel’s worship (Exod 31:1–6). The Spirit was distributed among the elders so the burden of leadership would be shared (Num 11:25). Even now, gifts are given “to equip the saints… for building up the body of Christ” (Eph 4:12).

When spiritual gifts are used correctly, Christ becomes clearer and the church becomes stronger. When gifts are used for show or prestige, they are already being misused, even if the gift itself is real. The Spirit does not exist to make us impressive. He works to make us like Christ (Rom 8:29) and to glorify Him (John 16:14).

The question for us is simple: are we using what God has given us to elevate ourselves, or to build up the body and lead others toward Christ?

  “Pursue love, and earnestly desire the spiritual gifts, especially that you may prophesy. For one who speaks in a tongue speaks not to men but to God; for no one understands him, but he utters mysteries in the Spirit. On the other hand, the one who prophesies speaks to people for their upbuilding and encouragement and consolation. The one who speaks in a tongue builds up himself, but the one who prophesies builds up the church.  Now I want you all to speak in tongues, but even more to prophesy. The one who prophesies is greater than the one who speaks in tongues, unless someone interprets, so that the church may be built up.” (1 Corinthians 14:1-5, ESV)

After showing us the supremacy of love in chapter 13, Paul does not change subjects. He gives us the governing command: “Pursue love, and earnestly desire the spiritual gifts, especially that you may prophesy” (1 Cor. 14:1).

Love comes first.

In Corinth, spiritual expression had become impressive, even mysterious. Tongues were dramatic. They felt powerful. But Paul gently reorients the church. The question is not, “What feels spiritual?” but “What builds the church?”

“The one who speaks in a tongue builds up himself, but the one who prophesies builds up the church” (v.4).

To “prophesy” here is not reckless declarations of, “Thus says the Lord,” as though we were adding new revelation. Paul has already taught that we operate by the wisdom of the Spirit, not the wisdom of the world (1 Cor. 2:12–13). In our age, we speak prophetically when we speak the revealed Word of God clearly and apply it faithfully. We take what God has already said and bring it to bear on real lives, real struggles, real joys.

This is not flashy. It is not mysterious. It is loving.

When a brother reminds you of God’s promises in suffering, that is prophetic. When a sister gently corrects you with Scripture, that is prophetic. When we read the Word together and apply it to our lives, that is prophetic speech. It builds up. It encourages. It consoles (v.3).

Love does not seek to elevate self (1 Cor. 13:5). Love asks, “How can I strengthen Christ’s body?” Each of us is essential to this work. The church is not built by spectacle, but by faithful, clear, Spirit-shaped words spoken from Scripture into one another’s lives.

So pursue love first. Desire to speak in ways that strengthen others. A clear word from God’s Word will always build more deeply than anything merely impressive.

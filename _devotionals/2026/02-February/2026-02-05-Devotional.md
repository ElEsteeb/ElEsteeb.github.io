<div class="scripture">
  “For just as the body is one and has many members, and all the members of the body, though many, are one body, so it is with Christ. For in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body—Jews or Greeks, slaves or free—and all were made to drink of one Spirit. For the body does not consist of one member but of many.” (1 Corinthians 12:12-14, ESV)

Paul reminds the church that unity is not merely a goal to pursue, but a reality already established by God Himself. “For just as the body is one and has many members… so it is with Christ” (1 Corinthians 12:12). The church is not a collection of independent believers trying to cooperate; it is one living body joined together in Christ. This unity exists because “in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body… and all were made to drink of one Spirit” (1 Corinthians 12:13). Every believer shares the same spiritual life source.

Scripture leaves no room for a two-tier Christianity. John writes, “You have been anointed by the Holy One” (1 John 2:20), and again, “the anointing that you received from him abides in you” (1 John 2:27). Every true believer is indwelt by the same Holy Spirit. Yet this same Spirit distributes gifts according to His will (1 Corinthians 12:11), not so that some may boast over others, but so that the whole body may be built up. As Paul says elsewhere, “We, though many, are one body in Christ, and individually members one of another” (Romans 12:5).

Because we share one life in Christ, we are bound to one another in real spiritual union. If one member suffers, all suffer together; if one is honored, all rejoice together (1 Corinthians 12:26). The gifts given to us are not personal trophies or platforms for recognition. They are provisions from the Spirit for the strengthening of Christ’s body. Knowledge must not produce pride (1 Corinthians 8:1). Spiritual gifting must not produce division (1 Corinthians 1:10).

This shared life points forward to Paul’s coming teaching on love. If we truly live by the same Spirit, then our gifts must operate for the good of others, not for self-exaltation. The church grows “when each part is working properly” (Ephesians 4:16), and all of it flows from Christ, “from whom the whole body… grows with a growth that is from God” (Colossians 2:19).

We are one body, sharing one Spirit, living one life in Christ, to the glory of the Father (Ephesians 4:4–6).

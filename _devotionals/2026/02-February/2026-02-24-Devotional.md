<div class="scripture">
  “Now, brothers, if I come to you speaking in tongues, how will I benefit you unless I bring you some revelation or knowledge or prophecy or teaching? If even lifeless instruments, such as the flute or the harp, do not give distinct notes, how will anyone know what is played? And if the bugle gives an indistinct sound, who will get ready for battle? So with yourselves, if with your tongue you utter speech that is not intelligible, how will anyone know what is said? For you will be speaking into the air. There are doubtless many different languages in the world, and none is without meaning, but if I do not know the meaning of the language, I will be a foreigner to the speaker and the speaker a foreigner to me. So with yourselves, since you are eager for manifestations of the Spirit, strive to excel in building up the church.” (1 Corinthians 14:6-12, ESV)

The Corinthians prized speaking in tongues. It seemed powerful, mysterious, deeply spiritual. But Paul does not rebuke the gift itself. Instead, he asks a piercing question: How does this help the church?
“If I come to you speaking in tongues, how will I benefit you?” (1 Corinthians 14:6, ESV). Even Paul, an apostle, refuses to measure spirituality by display. If his speech does not bring “revelation or knowledge or prophecy or teaching,” it does not serve them.
He gives simple illustrations: musical instruments must produce distinct notes (vv.7–8). A trumpet must give a clear call, or the soldiers will not prepare for battle. Sound without clarity creates confusion. And confusion does not build up Christ’s body.
The issue is not tongues alone. The issue is self-centered spirituality. Any manifestation of the Spirit can be twisted into something that inflates the ego rather than strengthens the church. Teaching can become performance. Leadership can become control. Service can become self-promotion.
But love asks a different question: Is this beneficial to my brothers and sisters?
Paul reminds them, “Since you are eager for manifestations of the Spirit, strive to excel in building up the church” (v.12). The Spirit does not give gifts so that we may appear impressive. He gives gifts so that the body may grow (cf. Ephesians 4:11–12; 4:29).
Maturity is not measured by how dramatic our gifts appear, but by how clearly and humbly we use them for others. The wisdom of the Spirit directs every gift toward edification.
If what we do does not strengthen the church, it is not yet aligned with love. And if it is not aligned with love, it is not aligned with the Spirit who gave the gift.

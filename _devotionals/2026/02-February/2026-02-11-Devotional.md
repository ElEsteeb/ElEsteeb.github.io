<div class="scripture">
  “Now you are the body of Christ and individually members of it. And God has appointed in the church first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healing, helping, administrating, and various kinds of tongues. Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Do all work miracles? Do all possess gifts of healing? Do all speak with tongues? Do all interpret?” (1 Corinthians 12:27–30, ESV)
</div> 

Paul’s words cut directly against one of the most common temptations in the church: measuring belonging by function. In 1 Corinthians 12:27–30, Paul reminds believers that they are already the body of Christ, and individually members of it. Inclusion in Christ’s body is not earned through gifting, visibility, or role. It is established through union with Christ Himself (1 Corinthians 12:13; Galatians 3:28).
Paul then lists various roles and gifts, apostles, prophets, teachers, miracles, healings, helping, administrating, and tongues. The point is not to create a hierarchy of believers, but to show that God Himself appoints different functions within His church (1 Corinthians 12:28). The repeated rhetorical questions that follow, “Are all apostles? Are all prophets? … Do all speak with tongues?” (1 Corinthians 12:29–30), expect the same answer: no. God never intended every believer to function the same way.
This destroys the idea that there are classes of Christians based on gifting. No believer is more “included” because of a visible or dramatic gift, and no believer is less valuable because their service is quiet or unseen. Every good gift comes from God (James 1:17), and the Spirit distributes gifts according to His will, not according to human expectation or spiritual performance (1 Corinthians 12:11).
Scripture makes clear that salvation is individual, we are each saved by grace through faith (Ephesians 2:8–9). Yet salvation is never isolated. We are saved into a people, built together into a dwelling place for God (Ephesians 2:19–22; 1 Peter 2:9–10). In the same way, gifts are given to individuals, but always for the good of the whole body (1 Corinthians 12:7; 14:12).
Belonging comes before function. God unites His people as one body, then assigns roles according to His wisdom. The Spirit’s gifts will be present and active exactly as He desires, ensuring that every member contributes to the life, health, and growth of Christ’s church.

  “The eye cannot say to the hand, ‘I have no need of you,’ nor again the head to the feet, ‘I have no need of you.’” (1 Corinthians 12:21, ESV)
</div> 

Paul has already confronted envy in the body of Christ. Some believers looked at others’ gifts and assumed they were less important. Now, in 1 Corinthians 12:21, Paul turns to the opposite error: pride.

The Church is not a collection of strong individuals working near each other. It is a living body created by Christ Himself. Just as no single part of your physical body “is” you, no single Christian fulfills the calling of the Church alone.

God designed His people for interdependence. Romans 12:4–5 teaches that though we are many, we are one body in Christ, and individually members of one another. Ephesians 4:15–16 says the body grows only when each part works properly. Growth is not the result of one strong member. It is the result of the whole body functioning together under Christ the Head.

This confronts the modern temptation toward spiritual independence. Some claim they can follow Christ while remaining detached from His people. Scripture does not allow this. Hebrews 10:24–25 commands believers to gather and stir one another to love and good works. Ecclesiastes 4:9–12 reminds us that two are stronger than one, and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.

Pride says, “I am strong enough.” Christ says, “You part are a body.”

Even more seriously, Christ identifies Himself with His people. When Saul persecuted believers, Jesus asked, “Why are you persecuting Me?” (Acts 9:4–5). To dismiss or minimize other believers is to dismiss Christ’s design for His Church.

Biblical love is right relationship under God’s order. To love the body means refusing both envy and pride. It means receiving others as necessary gifts from Christ for your mutual growth and faithfulness.

Christ does not build isolated saints. He builds one body for His glory (1 Corinthians 12:27).

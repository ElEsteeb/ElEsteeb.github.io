  “To each is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the common good. For to one is given through the Spirit the utterance of wisdom, and to another the utterance of knowledge according to the same Spirit, to another faith by the same Spirit, to another gifts of healing by the one Spirit, to another the working of miracles, to another prophecy, to another the ability to distinguish between spirits, to another various kinds of tongues, to another the interpretation of tongues. All these are empowered by one and the same Spirit, who apportions to each one individually as he wills.” (1 Corinthians 12:7–11, ESV)

Paul reminds the Corinthians that “to each is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the common good” (1 Corinthians 12:7, ESV). The gifts of the Spirit are not isolated abilities meant to elevate individuals. They are coordinated manifestations of the same Spirit, given to build up the body of Christ. Wisdom does not stand apart from knowledge. Faith does not operate separate from wisdom or discernment. Miracles, healing, prophecy, tongues, and interpretation are not independent spiritual achievements. They are expressions of one Spirit working in unity and order.
Scripture consistently shows that what comes from God reflects His unified character. The Spirit glorifies Christ, not the individual (John 16:14). Every good and perfect gift comes from God (James 1:17). The body of Christ is designed so that no part can say to another, “I have no need of you” (1 Corinthians 12:21). When gifts are elevated above others or used to draw attention to a person, they are no longer reflecting the Spirit’s purpose.
In every generation, believers face two dangers. One is emotionalism that claims spiritual authority but is not grounded in truth, faith, or discernment. The other is prideful confidence in knowledge or wisdom that is disconnected from faith and dependence on God. Both distort what the Spirit produces. The Spirit does not create spiritual celebrities or cold intellectualism. He produces a people who are unified, grounded in truth, and centered on Christ.
Because the Spirit is one, His work will not contradict itself. Claims of spiritual manifestation must be tested (1 John 4:1). What truly comes from the Spirit will align with truth, produce humility, strengthen faith, and direct attention to Christ.
The Spirit distributes gifts “as he wills” (1 Corinthians 12:11), ensuring that the church functions as one body under one Lord. When the gifts work together in proper order, no person becomes the center of attention. Christ alone is exalted.

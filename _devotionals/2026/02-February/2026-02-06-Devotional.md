<div class="scripture">
  “For the body does not consist of one member but of many. If the foot should say, “Because I am not a hand, I do not belong to the body,” that would not make it any less a part of the body. And if the ear should say, “Because I am not an eye, I do not belong to the body,” that would not make it any less a part of the body. If the whole body were an eye, where would be the sense of hearing? If the whole body were an ear, where would be the sense of smell? But as it is, God arranged the members in the body, each one of them, as he chose. If all were a single member, where would the body be? As it is, there are many parts, yet one body.” (1 Corinthians 12:14-20, ESV)

Paul confronts a quiet but dangerous error inside the church: the belief that some believers matter less because their gifts are less visible. In 1 Corinthians 12:14–20, he corrects this thinking directly. If the foot says, “Because I am not a hand, I do not belong to the body,” it does not cease to be part of the body (1 Cor 12:15). The same is true for the ear comparing itself to the eye. Paul is not merely comforting insecurity, he is correcting false theology.
Every believer is placed intentionally by God. “But as it is, God arranged the members in the body, each one of them, as he chose” (1 Cor 12:18). Our value does not come from how visible our function is, but from the God who assigned it. The Spirit distributes gifts “as he wills” (1 Cor 12:11), and every believer shares in the same Spirit (1 Cor 12:13). Scripture is clear that all believers are anointed by the Spirit (1 John 2:20). There is no class of Christians who are gifted and another who are not.
Paul exposes envy by showing its absurdity. If the whole body were an eye, where would be the sense of hearing? If the whole body were hearing, where would be the sense of smell? (1 Cor 12:17). A body made of only one part would not be strong, it would be dysfunctional. Diversity of gifts is not a weakness in the church, it is evidence of God’s design.
This truth frees us from comparison. The gifts of others are not evidence of our lack. Instead, they are provision for the body we belong to. As Paul says elsewhere, we are “one body in Christ, and individually members one of another” (Rom 12:5). The church grows “when each part is working properly” (Eph 4:16).
If God has placed you in His body, you are necessary. Not because of how impressive your gift appears, but because Christ Himself has joined you to His people.

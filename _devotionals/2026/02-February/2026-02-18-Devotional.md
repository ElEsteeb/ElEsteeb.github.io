  “When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I gave up childish ways.” (1 Corinthians 13:11, ESV)
</div>

Christ calls us to childlike faith, not childish faith. Jesus tells us we must become like children (Matthew 18:3), meaning we approach God with trust, dependence, and humility. Yet Paul also commands us, “do not be children in your thinking” (1 Corinthians 14:20). The Christian life is not meant to remain in spiritual infancy. It is meant to grow into maturity.

Spiritual maturity is not measured by knowledge alone, nor by visible spiritual activity. According to Paul, maturity is revealed through love. As we learn and practice love, our transformation becomes visible. This is why Paul places this teaching in the middle of his discussion of love. Gifts may impress, but love proves formation. As John writes, “If we love one another, God abides in us and his love is perfected in us” (1 John 4:12).

Maturity is grown-up confidence in the commands of God. Scripture teaches that obedience is not bondage but freedom. Jesus says, “If you abide in my word… you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free” (John 8:31–32). James calls God’s Word “the law of liberty” (James 1:25). As we submit our will to God’s, we are not losing ourselves. We are becoming what we were created to be.

This maturity expresses itself relationally. We learn to “count others more significant than yourselves” (Philippians 2:3) and to “outdo one another in showing honor” (Romans 12:10). Love orders our lives correctly: God first, others second, and ourselves rightly placed within God’s design.

Childish faith demands control, recognition, and comfort. Childlike faith trusts, obeys, and loves. As we grow in love, we put away childish ways and step into the freedom and confidence of mature faith.

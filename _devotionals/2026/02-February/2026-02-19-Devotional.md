  “For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I have been fully known.” (1 Corinthians 13:12, ESV)
</div>

Paul continues his argument for the supremacy of love by contrasting immaturity with maturity. In verse 11, he speaks of putting away childish ways. In verse 12, he explains why: our present experience of Christ is real, but incomplete.

Corinth was famous in the ancient world for its polished bronze mirrors. They were known for quality craftsmanship, yet even the best mirror of that day produced an imperfect reflection. The image was true, but dim and indirect. When Paul says we see “in a mirror dimly,” the Corinthians would have understood immediately: what we see is genuine, but not yet clear.

The question is, what are we seeing? Ultimately, we are beholding Christ. As 2 Corinthians 3:18 says, we behold the glory of the Lord and are being transformed into His image. Yet in this age, we see Him through mediated revelation, through Scripture, through the Spirit’s work, through the life of the church. We are being conformed to the image of the Son (Romans 8:29), but the reflection is not yet perfect.
But then, Paul says, “face to face.” One day we will see Him as He is (1 John 3:2). Love will no longer be partial. Knowledge will no longer be limited. What we now pursue by faith will be our direct experience.

And yet, even now, we are “fully known.” God already knows us completely (Psalm 139:1–4). He knows the sons He is forming. He sees the finished work even while we still see dimly. Our future conformity to Christ is not uncertain to Him.

Therefore, hope and assurance are not excuses for immaturity. They are motivations for it. If we are destined to love as Christ loves, and already known as children of God, then we must grow up into that love now. Mature love is simply living today in light of what we will one day see clearly: Jesus Christ Himself.

  ”For anyone who eats and drinks without discerning the body eats and drinks judgment on himself.” (1 Corinthians 11:29, ESV)
</div> 

Paul issues his most severe warning in this letter at the Lord’s Table. To partake “in an unworthy manner” is not a matter of personal unworthiness, but of covenantal misuse. Those who eat and drink while despising their brothers are declared “guilty concerning the body and blood of the Lord” (1 Cor. 11:27). This is no empty symbol. The Supper is participation (1 Cor. 10:16), and participation brings accountability. 

The command is clear: “Let a person examine himself” (v. 28). This examination is not meant to drive believers away from the table, but to drive sin out of the heart. The failure Paul exposes is specific: “not discerning the body” (v. 29). This phrase reaches far deeper than mere ritual awareness. Christ has bound Himself to His people. To neglect, belittle, or humiliate a brother at the table is to do the same to Christ Himself.

Jesus had already warned, “As you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me” (Matt. 25:40). Paul learned this truth firsthand when the risen Christ confronted him: “Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?” (Acts 9:4). Christ is not divided (1 Cor. 1:13). To wound His body is to offend the Head.

Paul does not speculate about consequences. He states them plainly: “That is why many of you are weak and ill, and some have died” (1 Cor. 11:30). This does not mean that every sickness or death is God’s judgment. Scripture forbids such simplifications (John 9:3). Yet it equally forbids denying that God’s judgment among His people is real. “The Lord disciplines the one he loves” (Heb. 12:6), and that discipline may be severe. Nadab and Abihu learned this when they approached God carelessly (Lev. 10:1–3). Israel learned it when they treated God’s provision with contempt (Num. 11:33).

This judgment is not condemnation. “When we are judged by the Lord, we are disciplined so that we may not be condemned along with the world” (1 Cor. 11:32). It is mercy with teeth. Our God is not tame. “Our God is a consuming fire” (Heb. 12:29). He will not be mocked (Gal. 6:7). He will not allow His Son to be misrepresented by pride, division, or loveless worship.

When the church gathers, we gather as the body of Christ (1 Cor. 12:27). Bought with a price (1 Cor. 6:20), we are called to reflect the One who did not seek His own will, but gave Himself for us (Phil. 2:5–8). Therefore, let us examine ourselves, discern the body rightly, and worship in a manner worthy of Christ, that He may be glorified and our witness remain true.

<div class="scripture">
  “Now I commend you because you remember me in everything and maintain the traditions even as I delivered them to you.” (1 Corinthians 11:2, ESV)
</div> 

Before Paul addresses one of the most complex and debated sections of the letter, he pauses to commend the Corinthians. This matters. Paul is not affirming that they have everything right, because much of the letter exists precisely because they do not. Instead, he is commending something quieter but deeply important: they asked.

The structure of 1 Corinthians makes this clear. Paul is responding to questions the church sent to him. They were confused. They were divided. They were often proud. Yet their pride had not hardened into isolation. They did not decide they were self-sufficient. They sought instruction from the one God had appointed to teach them. For that, Paul commends them.

When Paul says they “remember” him, he does not mean sentimental loyalty or attachment to a personality. He means they remember his teaching, his authority in Christ, and the gospel he delivered to them. Remembering, in Scripture, is active. It is the kind of remembering that returns for guidance when understanding falters. It is covenantal faithfulness, not passive recall.

This matters because the Christian life was never meant to be lived alone. God has always instructed His people through teachers He appoints. Christ gives shepherds and teachers to equip the saints (Ephesians 4:11–13). To seek help is not weakness; it is submission to God’s design. Refusing instruction, by contrast, is not independence but folly (Proverbs 12:15).

Paul’s commendation also reveals hope. Though the Corinthians often boast in knowledge, their knowledge has not yet replaced teachability. They are still reachable because they are still listening. Before Paul corrects them, he affirms this posture, knowing that difficult truth can only be received by a humble heart.

The lesson for us is simple and introspective. Confusion does not disqualify us from faithfulness. Pride does. We must never confuse maturity with self-sufficiency. Christians who refuse counsel are not strong; they are vulnerable.

Seek out help. Ask questions. Submit yourself to the wisdom God has placed in His church. The gospel flourishes not in isolation, but in humble dependence.

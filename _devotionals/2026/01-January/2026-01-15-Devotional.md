  “So, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God. Give no offense to Jews or to Greeks or to the church of God, just as I try to please everyone in everything I do, not seeking my own advantage, but that of many, that they may be saved.” (1 Corinthians 10:31–33, ESV)
</div> 

Paul brings his long argument about Christian freedom to a decisive conclusion: nothing we do is neutral. “So, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God” (v. 31). The most ordinary acts of life are placed under the highest possible purpose. Actions do not float in a moral vacuum. They either glorify God or they do not.

This explains why Paul immediately moves from God’s glory to the consciences of others. “Give no offense to Jews or to Greeks or to the church of God” (v. 32). Glory is not abstract. It is displayed through love that refuses to become a stumbling block. As Paul has argued repeatedly, knowledge alone puffs up, but love builds up (1 Cor. 8:1). Freedom is real, but it is governed by the spiritual good of others (1 Cor. 10:23–24).

At first glance, verse 33 seems contradictory. Paul says he tries to “please everyone in everything.” Yet elsewhere he insists that if he were trying to please man, he would not be a servant of Christ (Gal. 1:10). The tension dissolves when we remember the fruit of the Spirit. Paul lists love, kindness, gentleness, and self-control, and then concludes, “against such things there is no law” (Gal. 5:22–23). When our lives are shaped by Spirit-formed love, no legitimate accusation can be brought against us. This is not compromise, but wisdom.

Jesus Himself commands this posture: “Be wise as serpents and innocent as doves” (Matt. 10:16). Wisdom considers how actions will be received; innocence ensures that what is received is genuinely good. The goal is never personal comfort, but clarity. We do not want our freedoms to obscure Christ.

Christ Himself is the model. Though truly innocent, His accusers could not sustain a charge against Him, and even Pilate declared, “I find no guilt in him” (John 18:38). Peter applies this pattern to believers, urging conduct so honorable that accusations fall flat and God is glorified (1 Pet. 2:12).

We will fail, and there is grace. But Paul calls us to direction, not drift. The Christian life presses forward, striving to live so that God is honored, consciences are guarded, and the way of salvation is left unobstructed (1 Cor. 9:24–27).

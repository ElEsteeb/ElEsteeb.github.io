  “Be imitators of me, as I am of Christ.” (1 Corinthians 11:1, ESV)
</div> 

It is unfortunate that this verse is often read as though it begins a new thought. In reality, **1 Corinthians 11:1 is the exclamation point** on Paul’s argument in chapters 8–10. After calling the Corinthians to lay aside their rights for the sake of love (1 Corinthians 8:9–13), disciplining himself to avoid disqualification (1 Corinthians 9:24–27), and warning that those who think they stand must take heed lest they fall (1 Corinthians 10:12), Paul concludes with a startling statement: *imitate me, as I imitate Christ.*

This is the ultimate expression of self-denial. Paul does not exempt himself from the commands he gives to others. Instead, he places himself in a precarious position. Where others might appeal to privacy or offer explanations for inconsistency, Paul sets the target on himself. In effect, he says, **“Test me.”** Examine my life and see whether my teaching matches my practice.

This is not arrogance. It is accountability. Paul’s confidence is not in himself, but in the Christ he imitates. As he has urged the Corinthians to live free from corruption and ordered toward the strengthening of their brothers (1 Corinthians 10:23–24, 31–33), he demonstrates that same pattern in his own life.

This posture echoes the teaching of Jesus. When Christ says, *“Judge not, that you be not judged”* (Matthew 7:1), He does not forbid discernment. He condemns hypocrisy. *“With the measure you use it will be measured to you”* (Matthew 7:2). Paul lives this out by submitting himself to the same standard he proclaims.

This raises uncomfortable but necessary questions. **Do we test our leaders** to see whether their lives align with their teaching (Hebrews 13:7; 1 John 4:1)? **Do we test ourselves**, ensuring that we are not merely hearers but doers of the word (2 Corinthians 13:5; James 1:22)? Could we say, with integrity, *“do as I do **and** as I say”*?

Paul could, because his life was oriented toward Christ. Christian faith is not abstract. It is embodied. And a life shaped by Christ is one that can withstand examination.

  "After this I looked, and the sanctuary of the tent of witness in heaven was opened, and out of the sanctuary came the seven angels with the seven plagues, clothed in pure, bright linen, with golden sashes around their chests. And one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the wrath of God who lives forever and ever, and the sanctuary was filled with smoke from the glory of God and from his power, and no one could enter the sanctuary until the seven plagues of the seven angels were finished." (Revelation 15:5-8, ESV)
</div>

As Revelation 15 comes to a close, we see a striking vision of seven angels emerging from the sanctuary of the tent of witness. These are no ordinary angels; they are dressed in priestly garments, just as Jesus was in Revelation 1. This detail links them to the faithful believers—God’s holy people—who have been cleansed by the blood of the Lamb and are now entrusted with a divine mission.

The phrase "sanctuary of the tent of witness" does not merely refer to the temple but to the Holy of Holies—the very place where God’s presence dwelled above the mercy seat. This term, "mercy seat," is the same used in 1 John 2:2, where Jesus is called the "propitiation" for our sins. Just as the high priest under the old covenant would sprinkle blood before the mercy seat for atonement (Leviticus 16:14), now these purified messengers emerge, not to offer blood for atonement, but to pour out God’s judgment on those who have rejected Christ.

This imagery underscores the transition from the old covenant to the new. The physical temple has been replaced by a spiritual one—the church, the redeemed people of God (1 Peter 2:5; Ephesians 2:21-22). Just as God’s presence filled the tabernacle (Exodus 40:34-35) and Solomon’s temple (2 Chronicles 7:1-2), so too His presence fills this new temple. But this filling is not just for blessing—it is also for judgment. The old covenant system, which rejected Christ, now faces divine wrath.

This passage reminds us that as we proclaim the Gospel, we are not simply offering a message of salvation—we are also announcing God’s judgment against a world that refuses to submit to Jesus as the Christ. As Christ reigns over the nations (Psalm 2, Daniel 7), we, His holy army, march forward with the sword of the Spirit (Ephesians 6:17), declaring both His mercy and His justice. The message of the Gospel is life to those who believe, but to those who reject it, it is the announcement of their downfall (2 Corinthians 2:15-16).

Let us therefore stand firm in our calling, knowing that the presence of God goes before us. We proclaim both salvation and judgment, knowing that in the end, every knee will bow, and every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord (Philippians 2:10-11).

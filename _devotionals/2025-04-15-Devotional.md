<div class="scripture">
  “The great city was split into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell, and God remembered Babylon the great, to make her drain the cup of the wine of the fury of his wrath. And every island fled away, and no mountains were to be found. And great hailstones, about one hundred pounds each, fell from heaven on people; and they cursed God for the plague of the hail, because the plague was so severe.” (Revelation 16:19–21, ESV)
</div>

The imagery in Revelation 16:19–21 is both vivid and profound, symbolizing the culmination of divine judgment. The "great city" splitting into three parts can be seen as a reflection of internal division and turmoil. Historically, during the siege of Jerusalem in 70 AD, the city was indeed fractured—not just physically but socially and politically. The city itself was divided into the Upper City, the Lower City, and the Temple Mount. Josephus records that during the siege, the zealots were splintered into internal rivalries—John of Gischala, Simon bar Giora, and Eleazar controlled different parts of the city, which weakened the defense and contributed to the city’s downfall.

This internal strife mirrors the prophetic actions of Ezekiel, who was instructed to divide his hair into three parts, each representing a portion of the people and their fate (Ezekiel 5:1–5). Such divisions signify judgment and the consequences of turning away from divine guidance.

The mention of massive hailstones, each about a hundred pounds, brings to mind the account of Jesus ben Ananias, a plebeian farmer who, according to Josephus, prophesied the city's destruction for over seven years. Even enduring scorn and beatings while he prophesied. He was eventually killed by a stone launched by a Roman catapult during the siege. Josephus even describes how these stones were white and so massive they could be seen in the air before impact—some sources even say they weighed around a talent (75-100 lbs).

Revelation 16:19–21 serves as a poignant reminder of the consequences of internal division, ignoring prophetic warnings, and turning away from divine truth. The historical events surrounding Jerusalem's fall provide a tangible backdrop to the symbolic language of Revelation, emphasizing the importance of unity, vigilance, and adherence to spiritual truths. May we not only seek unity, but unity in the truth of Christ.

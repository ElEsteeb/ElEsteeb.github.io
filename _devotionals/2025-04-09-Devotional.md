<div class="scripture">
  “The fifth angel poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast, and its kingdom was plunged into darkness. People gnawed their tongues in anguish and cursed the God of heaven for their pain and sores. They did not repent of their deeds.” (Revelation 16:10–11, ESV)
</div>

This fifth bowl judgment echoes the fifth trumpet (Revelation 9:1–11) and targets the very heart of the beast’s kingdom. We understand the beast as Nero and Rome itself, as we have discussed before, then this bowl being poured on “the throne of the beast” fits with the historical collapse that followed Nero’s suicide in AD 68. The Roman Empire plunged into chaos during the “Year of the Four Emperors,” and the spiritual darkness and political instability that followed cast a long shadow over the empire.

At the same time, in Judea, Vespasian's campaign against the Jewish revolt would lead to the destruction of the Jerusalem Temple in AD 70. That both the temple of Jupiter in Rome and the temple in Jerusalem were destroyed within a short period underscores the collapse of the old world order—both Jewish and Gentile systems that had rejected Christ. Judgment fell not only on Israel, but also on the Gentile powers they had turned to instead of God (John 19:15).

And yet, the response to these judgments was not repentance, but defiance. As Revelation 16:11 says, “they cursed the God of heaven... They did not repent of their deeds.” Even suffering and chaos failed to humble them. This reminds us of Jesus’ parable in Luke 16:31—those who reject God’s Word will not be convinced even by miracles or catastrophe.

This passage warns us not to assume that suffering alone will turn hearts to God. Only the Spirit, working through the Word, brings true repentance. It is God that gifts us the ability to repent. We must proclaim that Christ is King and His Kingdom is advancing, and that judgment is a call to repentance. As His people, we carry that message with boldness, even when the world gnashes its teeth against God while walking in darkness.

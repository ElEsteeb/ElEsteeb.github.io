<div class="scripture">
  "And another angel, a third, followed them, saying with a loud voice, 'If anyone worships the beast and its image and receives a mark on his forehead or on his hand, he also will drink the wine of God's wrath, poured full strength into the cup of his anger, and he will be tormented with fire and sulfur in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb. And the smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever, and they have no rest, day or night, these worshipers of the beast and its image, and whoever receives the mark of its name.'" (Revelation 14:9-11, ESV)
</div>

This passage presents a sobering reality: those who reject Jesus will face eternal judgment. The angel's warning is clear — God's wrath will be poured out "full strength" on those who worship the beast. Yet what stands out is that this torment occurs "in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb." Hell is not a place where the condemned are separated from God entirely, but rather where they face His unrelenting justice without any covering of grace.

This truth echoes Paul's teaching in Romans 9:22-23, where God’s enduring patience with "vessels of wrath" serves to reveal His glory more fully to "vessels of mercy." Just as God's mercy magnifies His grace, His justice magnifies His holiness. For believers, this reality deepens our gratitude — our salvation is not merely an escape from punishment, but a gift that allows us to behold His glory in love rather than wrath.

For those who trust in Christ, this passage is both a comfort and a call to action. We rejoice in the mercy we’ve received, but we are also reminded of the urgent need to proclaim the gospel. Judgment is real, and those who persist in rebellion will know only His wrath. Our mission is clear: to point sinners to the Lamb who offers mercy now, before the day comes when only His justice remains.

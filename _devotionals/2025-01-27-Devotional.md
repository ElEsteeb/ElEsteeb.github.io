>**Revelation 3:12-13 ESV**
>"The one who conquers, I will make him a pillar in the temple of my God. Never shall he go out of it, and I will write on him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, which comes down from my God out of heaven, and my own new name. [13] He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches."

In these verses, Jesus promises again to reward us if we overcome: we will be made a "pillar in the temple" of God. A pillar is not merely a functional part of a structure; it is a symbol of strength, permanence, and honor. To be made a pillar in God’s temple speaks to an eternal, unshakable place in His presence. For believers enduring trials, this promise assures us that perseverance leads to an unending stability in the Lord.

Jesus offers a stunning promise to those who overcome: they will be marked with three names. Each name carries a great significance, revealing God’s purpose for His people and the eternal blessings awaiting them.

The first name is "the name of my God." This represents ownership and belonging. To bear the name of God is to be declared His forever—a mark of intimacy and divine favor. It is a reminder that no matter the trials we face, we belong to the One who is sovereign over all creation. The world may try to define us, but God’s name upon us declares our identity as His children, secure in His love.

The second name is "the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem." This points to our citizenship in heaven. The new Jerusalem is the eternal dwelling place of God’s people, where His glory will shine forever (Revelation 21:2-3). To carry the name of this city is to know that our final home is not here on earth but in the presence of God. For believers enduring hardship, this is a comforting reminder that every trial is temporary, and an eternal kingdom awaits. (2 Corinthians 4:17-18)

Finally, Jesus promises to write on the conqueror "my own new name." This personalizes the relationship between Christ and His followers. While Scripture does not reveal the details of this new name, it reflects a unique, eternal bond between the Savior and each individual believer. It signifies transformation, as we will be made completely new in Christ, fully reflecting His glory.

Together, these names remind us who we are, where we belong, and to whom we are united forever. In a world full of uncertainty and shifting identities, take heart in this truth: you are marked by God, destined for His eternal city, and bound to Christ in unbreakable love. Let this hope empower you to overcome whatever trials come your way today.

  "Then I saw another sign in heaven, great and amazing, seven angels with seven plagues, which are the last, for with them the wrath of God is finished. And I saw what appeared to be a sea of glass mingled with fire—and also those who had conquered the beast and its image and the number of its name, standing beside the sea of glass with harps of God in their hands. And they sing the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, “Great and amazing are your deeds, O Lord God the Almighty! Just and true are your ways, O King of the nations! Who will not fear, O Lord, and glorify your name? For you alone are holy. All nations will come and worship you, for your righteous acts have been revealed.” (Revelation 15:1-4, ESV)

Revelation 15:1-4 presents a triumphant scene, echoing Israel’s victory at the Red Sea. The faithful stand before God, victorious over the beast, singing the song of Moses and the song of the Lamb. Just as Israel was mustered like an army before their great deliverance, so too are believers gathered in victory, not through earthly might, but through the power of God.

This passage reminds us of God’s covenant faithfulness. The song of Moses was sung after God delivered Israel from Egypt (Exodus 15), and now, in Revelation, the song is renewed in celebration of an even greater deliverance—the triumph of Christ’s kingdom. The reference to all nations coming to worship God points to the fulfillment of the Great Commission (Matthew 28:19-20), as the Gospel goes forth, conquering hearts and bringing all peoples under the reign of Christ, just as promised in Psalm 2 and Daniel 7.

As believers, we are not merely passive observers; we are part of the advancing kingdom of God. We are more than conquerors (Romans 8:37), not through force, but through faithfulness. The battle is fought with the Word of God, the sword of the Spirit (Ephesians 6:17). The "song" we sing is the proclamation of the Gospel—declaring the mighty works of God and His righteous reign over all the earth.

Let this passage be a reminder: we stand in victory because Christ has conquered. The nations rage, but they will ultimately bow before the Lord. Until that final fulfillment, we march forward, singing the truth of God’s Word, knowing that the kingdom of Christ will prevail.

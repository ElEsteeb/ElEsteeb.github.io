>**Revelation 4:3 ESV**
>"And he who sat there had the appearance of jasper and carnelian, and around the throne was a rainbow that had the appearance of an emerald."

John’s vision of God’s throne is breathtaking, filled with symbols of divine majesty, holiness, and covenant faithfulness. The imagery of jasper and carnelian (sardius) reveals different aspects of God’s character. Jasper, often associated with clarity and brilliance, reflects His purity and unapproachable light (1 Timothy 6:16). Carnelian, a deep red stone, may symbolize both God’s righteous judgment (Revelation 6:10) and the sacrificial blood of Christ (1 Peter 1:18-19). Together, these stones remind us that God is both holy and the source of our redemption.

Encircling the throne is a rainbow, described as having the appearance of an emerald. The rainbow first appears in Genesis 9:13-16 as a sign of God’s covenant with Noah, a promise of mercy amid judgment. In Revelation, it surrounds God’s throne, reinforcing His faithfulness and grace even as He prepares to bring final justice. The emerald-like quality of the rainbow suggests renewal and life, pointing forward to the restoration of all things (Revelation 21:5).

This vision calls us to worship in awe and confidence. The God who reigns in holiness is also the God who redeems and sustains His people. His throne is not only a place of judgment but also a place of mercy, encircled by the very promise of His faithfulness. Let this image shape your faith today—rest in the certainty that the One who sits enthroned is both righteous and gracious, unchanging in His love and power (Hebrews 13:8).

>**Revelation 5:6 (ESV)**
>"And between the throne and the four living creatures and among the elders I saw a Lamb standing, as though it had been slain, with seven horns and with seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent out into all the earth."

The vision of Christ in Revelation 5:6 presents a paradox—Jesus is both the conquering Lion and the slain Lamb. In Revelation 5:5, He is called the "Lion of the tribe of Judah" who has triumphed, yet He appears as a Lamb that was slain. This is the mystery of His victory: through His suffering, He overcame the power of sin and death (Isaiah 53:5). His seven horns symbolize perfect power (Daniel 7:14), and His seven eyes represent divine omniscience, the fullness of the Spirit sent throughout the earth (Zechariah 4:10). Though the world rejected Him (John 1:11), He now stands alive, reigning at the right hand of God (Hebrews 1:3).

This passage reminds us that true victory comes through apparent weakness. Jesus conquered not by force, but by surrendering to the will of the Father (Philippians 2:8). His wounds testify to His love (John 15:13), His scars declare His authority (John 20:27-28), and His resurrection proclaims His eternal reign (Romans 6:9). Because He has overcome, we can take heart in our trials (John 16:33), knowing that our struggles are not meaningless but are producing an eternal glory (2 Corinthians 4:17).

In a world obsessed with strength and self-sufficiency, this vision calls us to a different kind of power—the power of surrender to God’s perfect will (2 Corinthians 12:9-10). Just as Jesus’ sacrifice ushered in His greatest glory (Hebrews 12:2), our faithfulness in trials will be met with eternal reward (James 1:12). The Lamb reigns, and because He does, we have unshakable hope (1 Peter 1:3-4).

>**Revelation 4:9-11 ESV**
>"and whenever the living creatures give glory and honor and thanks to him who is seated on the throne, who lives forever and ever, [10] the twenty-four elders fall down before him who is seated on the throne and worship him who lives forever and ever. They cast their crowns before the throne, saying, [11]  “Worthy are you, our Lord and God, to receive glory and honor and power, for you created all things, and by your will they existed and were created.”

In John's vision of heaven, he sees an unceasing display of worship, where the redeemed—represented by the twenty-four elders—fall before God's throne and cast their crowns at His feet. These crowns, symbols of their faithfulness and reward (James 1:12; 2 Timothy 4:8), are surrendered in recognition that all honor belongs to God alone. This scene calls us to examine our own hearts: do we hold onto our achievements and status, or do we acknowledge that everything we have is a gift from the One who reigns forever?

The elders' worship is rooted in the reality of God's absolute sovereignty. They proclaim His worthiness to receive all glory, honor, and power, not simply because of what He has done, but because of who He is. He is the Creator, and by His will, all things exist (Colossians 1:16). The world may deny His authority, but in heaven, there is no question—every knee bows before Him (Philippians 2:10-11). If the redeemed in heaven live in total surrender to God, how much more should we, while still on earth, give Him our full devotion?

True worship is not just singing praises; it is the posture of a heart that recognizes God's supremacy in all things. The elders don’t hold onto their crowns—they joyfully lay them down, acknowledging that their victories are His. Likewise, we are called to lay down our own pride, accomplishments, and self-sufficiency, surrendering them at the feet of the One who alone is worthy. Our purpose is not to exalt ourselves but to glorify the One who created us for His pleasure (Isaiah 43:7).

One day, we too will stand before the throne, joining the chorus of the redeemed. Until then, our lives should echo this heavenly reality—living in constant worship, surrender, and awe of our sovereign King. Whatever we have achieved, whatever rewards we receive, may we be found willing to cast them before His throne, proclaiming with the elders: “Worthy are you, our Lord and God.”

>**Revelation 6:9-11 ESV**
>"When he opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the word of God and for the witness they had borne. [10] They cried out with a loud voice, “O Sovereign Lord, holy and true, how long before you will judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth?” [11] Then they were each given a white robe and told to rest a little longer, until the number of their fellow servants and their brothers should be complete, who were to be killed as they themselves had been."

Across the world today, believers are still laying down their lives for the testimony of Jesus. From underground churches in Asia to war-torn regions in the Middle East, the blood of the saints continues to be spilled. Yet, what the enemy intends for destruction, Christ uses for victory (Genesis 50:20). The Lamb who opened the scroll has decreed that even martyrdom serves His unstoppable kingdom (Matthew 16:18).

The cry of the martyrs echoes through the centuries: “How long, O Lord?” This is not a question of doubt but a declaration of faith. They know that Christ reigns, and they eagerly await His justice. In A.D. 70, God answered the cries of the first-century martyrs by bringing judgment upon Jerusalem (Matthew 23:35-36), proving that He is faithful. But His work is not yet done. Even now, He clothes His suffering saints in white robes, assuring them that their sacrifice is not in vain (Revelation 3:5).

The world sees persecution as defeat, but in Christ’s kingdom, it is the seed of victory. Tertullian’s words remain true: “The blood of the martyrs is the seed of the church.” Where believers are slain, the gospel flourishes. Where governments seek to silence the Word, it spreads with greater power (Acts 8:1-4). The church does not shrink back in fear, for Jesus reigns, and His kingdom will cover the earth (Daniel 2:34-35).

So take heart. We may not all be called to die for Christ, but we are all called to live boldly for Him. Stand firm, knowing that not one drop of His saints’ blood is wasted. The Lamb is on the throne, the gospel is advancing, and the day is coming when the full number of His people will be gathered, and justice will be complete- His kingdom a visible reality. Until then, we press on, proclaiming His name in every nation, knowing that even in our suffering, Christ is victorious (1 Corinthians 15:24-25).

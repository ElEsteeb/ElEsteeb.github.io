>**Revelation 5:13-14 ESV**
>"And I heard every creature in heaven and on earth and under the earth and in the sea, and all that is in them, saying, “To him who sits on the throne and to the Lamb be blessing and honor and glory and might forever and ever!” [14] And the four living creatures said, “Amen!” and the elders fell down and worshiped."

Did you know ***you*** appear in the book of Revelation?

This moment is the climax of worship in heaven. It is not just angels or the redeemed who lift their voices—it is every creature. That includes you. That includes all who have ever lived. This passage reveals that, one day, every being in creation will declare the glory of Jesus Christ (Philippians 2:10-11). Whether in joyful submission or in awe-struck recognition, no voice will remain silent.

The Lamb, Jesus Christ, is at the center of this cosmic chorus. He alone is worthy to receive honor and might because He was slain and by His blood ransomed people from every tribe, language, and nation (Revelation 5:9). His victory over sin and death has secured His eternal reign, and all creation will acknowledge His rightful rule (Colossians 1:16-17).

This passage should stir our hearts. The worship of Jesus is not something reserved for the future—it begins now. If all creation will one day bow before Him, how much more should we, who have already tasted His grace? Let your life be an echo of this heavenly song, giving Christ the worship He is due today and forever.

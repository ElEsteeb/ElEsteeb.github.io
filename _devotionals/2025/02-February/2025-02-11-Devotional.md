>**Revelation 5:4-5 ESV**
>"and I began to weep loudly because no one was found worthy to open the scroll or to look into it. [5] And one of the elders said to me, “Weep no more; behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has conquered, so that he can open the scroll and its seven seals.”

John’s sorrow in this vision reflects the hopelessness of a world bound in sin, unable to bring about its own redemption. The sealed scroll represents God's divine plan, but no one in heaven or earth is worthy to break its seals. Without a worthy Redeemer, God's purposes seem stalled, and all creation is left groaning under the weight of sin (Romans 8:22). But John's weeping is interrupted by the elder’s triumphant proclamation—there is One who is worthy.

Jesus is identified as the Lion of the tribe of Judah (Genesis 49:9-10), fulfilling Jacob’s ancient prophecy that a ruler would arise from Judah, holding an everlasting scepter. He is also the Root of David (Isaiah 11:1, 10), the promised King who would establish God’s kingdom forever. His worthiness is not in mere lineage but in His conquest—He has conquered sin, death, and Satan through His sacrificial death and victorious resurrection (Colossians 2:15, 1 Corinthians 15:57).

In Christ, every Old Testament promise of a coming Deliverer finds its fulfillment (Luke 24:44). He is not only the mighty Lion but also the Lamb who was slain (Revelation 5:6). His triumph is paradoxical—the King reigns by laying down His life (John 10:17-18). Because of His victory, the scroll can be opened, God’s plan moves forward, and all who trust in Him share in His triumph (2 Timothy 2:12). Weep no more—our Redeemer reigns!

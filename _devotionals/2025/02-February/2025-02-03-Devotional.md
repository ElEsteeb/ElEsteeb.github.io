>**Revelation 4:1-2 ESV**
>"After this I looked, and behold, a door standing open in heaven! And the first voice, which I had heard speaking to me like a trumpet, said, “Come up here, and I will show you what must take place after this.” [2] At once I was in the Spirit, and behold, a throne stood in heaven, with one seated on the throne."

John’s vision begins with an open door in heaven, a door that was not found or forced open but set before him by divine authority. This door represents access to God, yet Scripture makes it clear that there is only one way to enter—through Jesus Christ. In John 10:9, Jesus declares, “I am the door. If anyone enters by me, he will be saved.” This exclusive claim leaves no room for alternatives; there is no other entrance into God’s presence, no other way to eternal life.

Beyond the door, John sees a throne, and upon it, only one is seated. The singularity of this imagery is crucial—there are not many thrones or competing rulers, only one sovereign Lord who reigns over all. This directly confronts the human tendency to seek security in earthly power, personal wisdom, or religious pluralism. It is God alone who governs history, who knows the future, and who calls His people to Himself.

As the vision unfolds, the authority of the One on the throne becomes undeniable. In a world of uncertainty and shifting allegiances, Revelation 4 reminds us that there is only one King, only one way, and only one who knows what is to come. The question remains—have you entered through the door, or are you seeking another way?

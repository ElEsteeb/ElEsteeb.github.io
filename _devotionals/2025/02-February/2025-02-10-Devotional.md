>**Revelation 5:1-3 ESV**
>"Then I saw in the right hand of him who was seated on the throne a scroll written within and on the back, sealed with seven seals. [2] And I saw a mighty angel proclaiming with a loud voice, “Who is worthy to open the scroll and break its seals?” [3] And no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth was able to open the scroll or to look into it"

The scene unfolds in the throne room of heaven. God, sovereign over all, holds in His right hand a sealed scroll—His divine decree for history, the unfolding of redemption and judgment. But it is sealed, its contents locked away, and the angel’s voice rings through the heavens with a question that shakes the cosmos: Who is worthy?

Silence answers. No angel steps forward. No patriarch, no prophet, no king of men. Not even the great hosts of heaven dare to approach the throne. The weight of unworthiness presses upon creation, revealing a terrible truth—left to ourselves, we are helpless. The purposes of God remain sealed, untouchable, if there is no one to open the scroll. The tension hangs heavy, and the question lingers.

If no one is worthy, then what hope remains? If the scroll remains sealed, where does history lead? This moment in John’s vision is meant to shake us, to expose our frailty. The power to enact God’s will, to bring His kingdom to completion, is beyond us. And if there is no one who can open the scroll, then all is lost.

The answer has not yet come, and so we wait. But in that waiting, we are forced to ask ourselves: Do we grasp the weight of our own insufficiency? Do we feel the gravity of creation’s silence? The one who can break the seals is not yet revealed—but when He comes, He will shake the reality itself!

<div class="scripture">
  “I appeal to you, brothers, bear with my word of exhortation, for I have written to you briefly. You should know that our brother Timothy has been released, with whom I shall see you if he comes soon. Greet all your leaders and all the saints. Those who come from Italy send you greetings. Grace be with all of you.” (Hebrews 13:22–25, ESV)

The writer of Hebrews ends his letter not with more lofty theology but with the gentle appeal of a caring brother: “Bear with my word of exhortation.” He acknowledges that his letter has been full, at times sharp, always weighty. Yet he calls it “brief,” as if to say: "There is so much more to say about Christ, but I have given you enough to hold fast." His final exhortation is simple: bear with it: carry these truths, let them shape your faith, and endure in Christ.

What truths must we bear with? That Jesus is better in every way. He is better than the angels, so we must pay much closer attention to what we have heard and not drift away (Heb. 2:1). He is better than Moses, faithful as a Son over God’s house, so we must exhort one another daily and hold fast to our confidence (Heb. 3:12–14). He is better than Joshua, for He offers true Sabbath rest, so we must strive to enter that rest through faith (Heb. 4:11). He is better than Aaron, as the eternal High Priest, so we must draw near with confidence to the throne of grace (Heb. 4:14–16).

He is mediator of a better covenant, with forgiveness written on our hearts, so we must hold fast our confession without wavering (Heb. 10:23). He has offered the better, once-for-all sacrifice, so we must draw near with full assurance of faith and not go on sinning willfully (Heb. 10:22, 26). He has opened a new and living way into the presence of God, so we must not neglect meeting together but stir one another up to love and good works (Heb. 10:24–25). He is the better example of faith, enduring the cross and now exalted, so we must run with endurance the race set before us, fixing our eyes on Him (Heb. 12:1–2). He has given us a better kingdom, unshakable and eternal, so we must be grateful and worship God with reverence and awe (Heb. 12:28).

All of these exhortations flow from the greatness of Christ. To “bear with” them means to treasure them, endure with them, and let them guide our steps until we see Him face to face. And the letter closes as all our endurance must: not in our strength, but in grace. “Grace be with all of you” (Heb. 13:25). The same grace that saved us, sustains us, and will carry us home is with us still.

Jesus Christ is better.

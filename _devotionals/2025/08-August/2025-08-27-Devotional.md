<div class="scripture">
  “As you come to him, a living stone rejected by men but in the sight of God chosen and precious, you yourselves like living stones are being built up as a spiritual house, to be a holy priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ. For it stands in Scripture: ‘Behold, I am laying in Zion a stone, a cornerstone chosen and precious, and whoever believes in him will not be put to shame.’” (1 Peter 2:4–6, ESV)
</div>

Peter continues his thought from 2:1–3, where believers are called to put away “all malice and all deceit” and instead crave the pure milk of the Word. This contrast runs through the Christian life: we reject the deceitful things of the world in order to embrace the true things of God, namely Jesus Christ. He is the “living stone,” rejected by men yet chosen and precious in the sight of God (Ps 118:22; Isa 28:16; Matt 21:42).

Those who believe in Christ are joined to Him and become “living stones” built into God’s spiritual house (Eph 2:19–22; 1 Cor 3:16–17). Just as the temple was once the place where God’s glory dwelt (Exod 25:8; 1 Kings 8:27), now His people are His dwelling, for “we are his house if indeed we hold fast our confidence” (Heb 3:6). John records that in the New Jerusalem “its temple is the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb” (Rev 21:22). Our dwelling place is with God, because we are His dwelling place, founded upon Christ the cornerstone.

As God’s house, we are also His “holy priesthood” (Exod 19:6; Rev 1:6; Rev 5:10). In Christ, the Eternal High Priest (Heb 7:23–27; 10:19–22), we offer “spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God” (Rom 12:1; Heb 13:15–16; Phil 4:18). At the heart of these sacrifices is faith, for “without faith it is impossible to please him” (Heb 11:6). When the crowds asked Jesus what was required to do the works of God, He answered plainly: “This is the work of God, that you believe in him whom he has sent” (John 6:29).

Therefore, the one who builds his life upon Christ will not be put to shame (Rom 9:33; Rom 10:11). The world may despise Him (and us along with Him, John 15:18–19) but in God’s eyes those who trust in His Son are honored. Our sacrifices of obedience mirror the once-for-all sacrifice of the Son, “that in everything he might be preeminent” (Col 1:18).

To reject deceit and trust Christ is to find stability, honor, and everlasting dwelling with God Himself.

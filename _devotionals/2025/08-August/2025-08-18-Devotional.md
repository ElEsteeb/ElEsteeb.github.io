<div class="scripture">
  “Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, To those who are elect exiles of the Dispersion in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia, according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, in the sanctification of the Spirit, for obedience to Jesus Christ and for sprinkling with his blood: May grace and peace be multiplied to you.” (1 Peter 1:1–2, ESV)
</div>

Peter begins his letter with a greeting that is anything but ordinary. He writes to Christians who are “elect exiles,” chosen by God, yet scattered across the world. Their exile is not an accident of history but part of God’s plan. From the very beginning, the Father has known and purposed their place, just as Paul reminds us that those whom God foreknew He also predestined to be conformed to the image of His Son (Romans 8:29).

This election is not left untouched, but comes alive “in the sanctification of the Spirit.” The Spirit sets God’s people apart, shaping them to live in holiness even while dwelling as strangers in this world. As Jesus prayed for His disciples, “Sanctify them in the truth; your word is truth” (John 17:17). Sanctification is not static, it is the Spirit’s ongoing work in us.

The purpose of this calling is “for obedience to Jesus Christ and for sprinkling with his blood.” Just as Israel was sprinkled with blood at Sinai to seal the covenant (Exodus 24:8), so Christians are cleansed and bound to God by the blood of Christ. Hebrews reminds us that Jesus is the mediator of a new covenant whose sprinkled blood speaks a better word (Hebrews 12:24). This blood not only cleanses us from sin (1 John 1:7) but also enables us to walk in obedience.

Peter closes the greeting with a prayer: “May grace and peace be multiplied to you.” Even in exile, God’s people are never without His abundant favor. As Christians, we may feel scattered, weary, or out of place, but we are chosen, sanctified, and cleansed by the Triune God. Take heart: your exile is not meaningless, it is part of His plan, and His grace and peace are yours in overflowing measure.

<div class="scripture">
  “For you have not come to what may be touched, a blazing fire and darkness and gloom and a tempest and the sound of a trumpet and a voice whose words made the hearers beg that no further messages be spoken to them. For they could not endure the order that was given, “If even a beast touches the mountain, it shall be stoned.” Indeed, so terrifying was the sight that Moses said, “I tremble with fear.” But you have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to innumerable angels in festal gathering, and to the assembly of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven, and to God, the judge of all, and to the spirits of the righteous made perfect, and to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood that speaks a better word than the blood of Abel. ” (Hebrews 12:18–24, ESV)

The writer of Hebrews urges his readers to remember what they have already received. They have not come to Mount Sinai, a place of fear and distance, where even Moses trembled (Exodus 19:16–25; Hebrews 12:21). Sinai represented a covenant of law and separation, warning the people to stay away lest they die. But we have come to Mount Zion, the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem. This is not a future hope alone, it is a present, spiritual reality that we enter through Christ.

We are not outside the gates. We are not told to stay back. We have been brought in, to the assembly of the firstborn, the joyful company of angels, to God the Judge of all, and to Jesus, the mediator of a better covenant (Hebrews 12:22–24). His sprinkled blood speaks a better word than the blood of Abel, not vengeance, but mercy and peace (Genesis 4:10; Hebrews 12:24). Through Him, we are not waiting to be accepted: we are accepted. We don’t beg for access: we have access (Hebrews 4:16; 10:19–22).

This is the city Abraham longed for, the one whose designer and builder is God (Hebrews 11:10). He saw it from a distance. We walk its streets in Spirit now. Revelation 21 declares this same city descending from heaven, the New Jerusalem where God dwells with His people. What Hebrews teaches is that this descent has already begun. The Church, indwelt by the Holy Spirit (Ephesians 2:22; 1 Corinthians 3:16), is the first glimpse of the city to come: a people in whom God dwells now.

So often we speak of “already but not yet” as if the emphasis lies on the waiting. But Hebrews insists that the “already” is the foundation of our perseverance. We do not run toward hope as though we were empty. We run because we have already been seated in heavenly places (Ephesians 2:6). We do not live as those outside the gate, hoping for permission to enter, we live as citizens of Zion. We are not climbing the mountain of the Lord; we are living on it.

Approach the throne boldly, not because you are special, but because Christ is better. Better than Sinai. Better than ceremony. Better than fear. And through Him, you have come to Zion.

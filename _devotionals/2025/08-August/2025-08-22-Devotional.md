<div class="scripture">
  “Therefore, preparing your minds for action, and being sober-minded, set your hope fully on the grace that will be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ. As obedient children, do not be conformed to the passions of your former ignorance, but as he who called you is holy, you also be holy in all your conduct, since it is written, ‘You shall be holy, for I am holy.’” (1 Peter 1:13–16, ESV)
</div>

Peter moves from celebrating salvation (vv.3–12) to calling believers to live out that salvation in daily life. The “therefore” ties our joy in Christ’s redemption to the nitty-gritty of holy living. We are not only redeemed: we are transformed to resemble our Father.

Peter begins with readiness: “gird up the loins of your mind.” This picture of tucking up robes before work or battle reminds us that holiness requires discipline. The Christian life is not passive; it is active, watchful, and intentional. Our hope is not in ourselves but fully in “the grace that will be brought” at Christ’s return. Hope fuels obedience.

As “obedient children,” our identity shapes our conduct. Just as children resemble their parents, so God’s children are called to resemble Him. Holiness is not about earning salvation, we already saw in verse 9 that salvation is the outcome of faith. Instead, holiness is our grateful response to God’s gift. We were made in His image (Gen. 1:26), marred by sin, and restored through Christ. Now we are to live out that restored image.

Peter calls the old life “former ignorance.” The old passions promised freedom but were empty. True wisdom begins with the fear of the Lord (Prov. 9:10). To live in holiness is not emotionally fragile or intellectually weak; it is a soberminded, joy-filled pursuit of Christ.

Holiness, then, flows from three realities: gratitude for salvation, resemblance to our Father, and hope in future grace. Because He is holy, His children must also be holy. So today, take one step of obedience (big or small) that reflects your Father’s holiness, and remember that His grace empowers every step you take.

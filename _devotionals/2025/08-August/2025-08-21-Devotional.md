  “Concerning this salvation, the prophets who prophesied about the grace that was to be yours searched and inquired carefully, inquiring what person or time the Spirit of Christ in them was indicating when he predicted the sufferings of Christ and the subsequent glories. It was revealed to them that they were serving not themselves but you, in the things that have now been announced to you through those who preached the good news to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven, things into which angels long to look.” (1 Peter 1:10-12, ESV)

Peter lifts the curtain on our place in God’s single storyline. The prophets “searched and inquired carefully” about “the grace that was to be yours,” as the Spirit of Christ pointed them to “the sufferings of Christ and the subsequent glories”. They were told that they were serving not themselves but us, as this salvation is now announced “by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven,” realities into which angels long to look.

This is almost a restatement of Hebrews 11:39–40. The faithful of old “did not receive what was promised” because God had “provided something better for us,” so that the story would reach its fullness with Christ and His people. What was promised in pieces and shadows is now revealed in the Son, whom the prophets foresaw and the apostles proclaim (Hebrews 1:1–2; Luke 24:26–27, 44). The mystery once hidden is now made known to the nations, “Christ in you, the hope of glory” (Colossians 1:26–27; Romans 16:25–26).

Peter just told us that our faith is refined through trials “so that the tested genuineness of your faith” results in “praise and glory and honor” at the revelation of Jesus Christ (1 Peter 1:6–9). The pattern holds together: first suffering, then glory. It was true of our Lord, who endured the cross and has been seated at the right hand of God (Hebrews 12:2; Philippians 2:8–11). It is true of His people, who share in His sufferings now and in His glory to come (Romans 8:18–25; 1 Peter 5:10).

How should we live within this privilege?

First, with worshipful awe. If angels bend low with holy curiosity at the gospel, then we as Christians should never grow tired of it. Every time we hear Christ preached in the Spirit’s power, we are tasting what prophets longed for and angels study with wonder (1 Peter 1:12; Ephesians 3:10; Acts 2:32–33).

Second, with humble gratitude. The prophets served us. Jeremiah’s new covenant and Ezekiel’s new heart reach their fulfillment for those who now trust Christ and receive the Spirit (Jeremiah 31:31–34; Ezekiel 36:26–27). We are heirs, not inventors.

Third, with hopeful endurance. Our trials are not accidents. They are the forge in which faith is purified so that our present obedience and love for the unseen Christ ripen into joy that is “inexpressible and filled with glory” as we obtain the outcome of our faith, the salvation of our souls (1 Peter 1:6–9).

Today, receive your place in this inheritance. Speak openly of what saints once glimpsed from afar (Hebrews 11:13). Endure, since glory comes after suffering. And worship, since heaven itself marvels at what you now possess in Christ.

  “Remember your leaders, those who spoke to you the word of God. Consider the outcome of their way of life, and imitate their faith.” (Hebrews 13:7, ESV)
</div>

God calls us to remember those who have led us in both teaching and example. Leaders in the church—whether pastors, teachers, or elders—are entrusted with a weighty responsibility. Preaching the gospel is an act of faith. Shepherding the flock is an act of faith. Living an honorable life in the sight of God and man is an act of faith.

Some of the early church leaders the writer of Hebrews referred to had already died, yet their faith still spoke through their example. Likewise, we have a heritage of faith stretching from the Old Testament saints to the apostles, through two millennia of church history, and into our own congregations today. These men and women, though imperfect, showed us that following God may be difficult, but it is always worth it.

Our calling is twofold: to pray for our leaders and to imitate their faith. This means considering how they trust God in trials, how they love His people, and how they hold fast to the truth. The story of the church is not merely an interesting historical record—it is our family tree. May we look to their example, be strengthened in our own walk, and give our leaders the encouragement they need to keep running the race with endurance.

>**Revelation 9:3-11 ESV**
>"Then from the smoke came locusts on the earth, and they were given power like the power of scorpions of the earth. [4] They were told not to harm the grass of the earth or any green plant or any tree, but only those people who do not have the seal of God on their foreheads. [5] They were allowed to torment them for five months, but not to kill them, and their torment was like the torment of a scorpion when it stings someone. [6] And in those days people will seek death and will not find it. They will long to die, but death will flee from them. [7]  In appearance the locusts were like horses prepared for battle: on their heads were what looked like crowns of gold; their faces were like human faces, [8] their hair like women’s hair, and their teeth like lions’ teeth; [9] they had breastplates like breastplates of iron, and the noise of their wings was like the noise of many chariots with horses rushing into battle. [10] They have tails and stings like scorpions, and their power to hurt people for five months is in their tails. [11] They have as king over them the angel of the bottomless pit. His name in Hebrew is Abaddon, and in Greek he is called Apollyon."

The locusts described in Revelation 9 are no ordinary insects. Unlike the locust swarms that devour fields and forests, these creatures are forbidden from harming vegetation. Instead, they are given power to torment those without God’s seal. Their unnatural behavior mirrors the horrifying spiritual reality that overtook Jerusalem during its siege.

In the Roman siege of Jerusalem, the city endured not only physical destruction but spiritual torment as well. Roman legions, often associated with the false god Apollo — who was depicted with a crown of golden rays like the “crowns of gold” described in Revelation 9:7 — swarmed Jerusalem like a locust plague. The siege lasted five months, matching the torment period described in Revelation 9:5. Those trapped inside faced unspeakable suffering: starvation, infighting, and despair consumed the city as if scorpions had stung their very souls.

Rome had promised peace, boasting in its Pax Romana, a stability they claimed would endure through Roman strength. Apollo, often invoked as a symbol of enlightenment and order, represented this ideal. Yet the torment of Jerusalem exposed that promise as empty. The peace Rome offered was fragile, resting on power and intimidation. In contrast, Jesus offers a peace that surpasses understanding — a peace that is not dependent on earthly circumstances (John 14:27; Philippians 4:7). While Rome’s peace was built on conquest, Christ’s peace is established by His sacrifice, securing eternal hope for those who trust in Him.

This torment had boundaries. The locusts could only harm those without God's seal (Revelation 9:4). For believers, this is a powerful reminder of God's mercy and protection. Even amid judgment, God preserves His people. Those who belong to Christ — marked not with a physical seal, but with the Holy Spirit. (Ephesians 1:13)

Rejecting God's call brings devastating consequences. Yet for those who cling to Christ, there is hope. While Rome’s false peace crumbled in fear and torment, Jesus remains the Prince of Peace, ruling with love and authority. If you feel tormented, trapped, or overwhelmed by the weight of life’s struggles, let this passage be a reminder to seek the One who gives true peace. Though the world may rage, Jesus is the Good Shepherd who guards His flock — and no power of darkness can snatch them from His hand (John 10:28). His peace is true peace that endures when all else fails.

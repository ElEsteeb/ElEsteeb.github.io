<div class="scripture">
  "Then I saw another beast rising out of the earth. It had two horns like a lamb and it spoke like a dragon. It exercises all the authority of the first beast in its presence, and makes the earth and its inhabitants worship the first beast, whose mortal wound was healed. It performs great signs, even making fire come down from heaven to earth in front of people, and by the signs that it is allowed to work in the presence of the beast it deceives those who dwell on earth, telling them to make an image for the beast that was wounded by the sword and yet lived." (Revelation 13:11-14, ESV)
</div>

The second beast in Revelation 13 appears gentle, resembling a lamb, yet its voice betrays its true nature—it speaks like a dragon. This beast symbolizes false religion supported by corrupt government rather than relying on truth's inherent power, a pattern seen throughout history.

We see this pattern clearly in Jesus' day when religious leaders collaborated with Rome to eliminate Him. As Caiaphas coldly calculated, "It is better for you that one man should die for the people, not that the whole nation should perish" (John 11:50). These leaders feared losing their influence as "the world has gone after him" (John 12:19). After Christ's ascension, they continued persecuting believers, demonstrating their dependence on political force rather than spiritual authority. As Peter and John observed when threatened by these leaders, "Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you rather than to God, you must judge" (Acts 4:19).

This pattern continues, whether through oppressive ideologies, corrupt religious systems, or divisive social movements, these "beasts" thrive by coercion, not truth. These movements that claim to offer peace, justice, or liberation often reveal dragon-like speech when they seek to silence opposition through coercion rather than persuasion by speaking the truth. Jesus warned us to "Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves" (Matthew 7:15). These movements gain influence not through truth but through signs and wonders that deceive—whether miraculous claims or promises of utopia that appeal to human desires. Their promises seem appealing, yet their words and actions reveal motives that oppose Christ’s kingdom.

As believers, we must be discerning. Our call is to remain faithful, grounded in Scripture, and anchored in the true peace that only Christ brings. While false systems require governmental enforcement to maintain control, the kingdom of God advances through truth, love, and the power of the Holy Spirit. As Paul reminds us, "For the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh but have divine power to destroy strongholds" (2 Corinthians 10:4). In a world of counterfeit lambs, may we recognize the true voice of our Shepherd and follow Him faithfully, even when the false prophets of our age demand our allegiance.

Endure with unwavering faith. The world may be filled with deceiving voices, but God's truth will prevail.

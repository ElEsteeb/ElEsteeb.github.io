<div class="scripture">
  "Here is a call for the endurance of the saints, those who keep the commandments of God and their faith in Jesus. And I heard a voice from heaven saying, 'Write this: Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on.' 'Blessed indeed,' says the Spirit, 'that they may rest from their labors, for their deeds follow them!'" (Revelation 14:12-13, ESV)
</div>

For the believer, endurance is not an empty struggle but a journey toward a promised reward. In contrast to those who receive God’s wrath, the saints are called to remain faithful, keeping God’s commandments and trusting in Jesus. This steadfast obedience is not without suffering, but it is with purpose. Every trial endured for Christ carries eternal significance.

Unlike the Old Testament saints, who often viewed death with uncertainty (Psalm 6:5, Ecclesiastes 9:5), Christians see it as a gateway to rest and reward. The Spirit affirms that those who die in the Lord are blessed—they rest from their labors, and their faithful deeds follow them. Our suffering in this life is temporary, but the glory we inherit is eternal (2 Corinthians 4:17). The call to endurance is not simply about holding on but pressing forward in the assurance that our struggles are not in vain.

This passage reminds us that perseverance is active. It means keeping God's commands, walking in faith, and setting our eyes on the hope of glory. As we endure trials, we do so knowing that our faithfulness will not be forgotten. The struggles of today are shaping us for the eternal joy of tomorrow.

Let us take heart in this promise. Death is not defeat; for those in Christ, it is the beginning of rest and eternal reward. May we endure with steadfast hearts, knowing that the best is yet to come.

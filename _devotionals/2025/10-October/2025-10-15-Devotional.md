<div class="scripture">
  “For since, in the wisdom of God, the world did not know God through wisdom, it pleased God through the folly of what we preach to save those who believe. For Jews demand signs and Greeks seek wisdom, but we preach Christ crucified, a stumbling block to Jews and folly to Gentiles, but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God. For the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.” (1 Corinthians 1:21-25, ESV)
</div>

Paul does not say that faith in Christ is foolish, but that the world perceives it as foolishness. God, in His wisdom, determined that humanity would not find Him through human intellect or philosophy but through the message of the cross. The gospel appears weak and irrational only to those who are perishing, for their hearts are darkened and their eyes blind to divine truth (Romans 1:21–22; John 3:19–20).

The Jews sought miraculous proof. Yet even after Jesus healed the sick, raised the dead, and calmed the sea, they demanded another sign (Matthew 12:38–40). Christ told them the only sign they would receive was His death and resurrection: the true sign of Jonah. The Greeks sought wisdom, searching for salvation through knowledge or enlightenment. But to them, a crucified God was absurd. The idea that the Creator would humble Himself, suffer, and die at the hands of His creation contradicted every human expectation (Philippians 2:6–8).

Yet in that very “foolishness,” God revealed His power and wisdom. The cross is not weakness; it is strength restrained for redemption. Christ’s death conquers sin and death precisely because it is God’s act of self-giving love, not man’s attempt to reach heaven. “The foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men” (v.25).

Those who are called (Jews or Greeks) see in Christ not folly but the very wisdom of God (Ephesians 1:17–19). What the world mocks, faith recognizes as glory. The wisdom of the cross humbles human pride and silences every boast. Salvation could not be discovered, invented, or achieved; it had to be revealed. And in revealing it through what appears weak, God exposes the bankruptcy of human reason and magnifies His eternal wisdom.

<div class="scripture">
  “This is how one should regard us, as servants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God. Moreover, it is required of stewards that they be found faithful. But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you or by any human court. In fact, I do not even judge myself. For I am not aware of anything against myself, but I am not thereby acquitted. It is the Lord who judges me. Therefore do not pronounce judgment before the time, before the Lord comes, who will bring to light the things now hidden in darkness and will disclose the purposes of the heart. Then each one will receive his commendation from God.” (1 Corinthians 4:1–5, ESV)

Paul’s words here have been twisted by many who wish to avoid accountability, claiming, “No one can judge me.” But Paul’s intent is the opposite. He has just rebuked the Corinthians for boasting in worldly wisdom and elevating human teachers (1 Cor 3:18–23). Now he tells them how ministers of Christ—and, by extension, all believers—should truly be regarded: not as celebrities or authorities, but as servants and stewards entrusted with God’s truth. The only measure that matters is faithfulness to Christ.

When Paul says he is unmoved by human judgment, he is not evading correction; he is rejecting a false standard. The Corinthians were judging by appearance, eloquence, and worldly success. Paul refuses to stand before that tribunal. Yet he quickly adds, “I am not thereby acquitted.” Even a clear conscience cannot justify a person, for our hearts are limited and deceptive (Jer 17:9; Prov 21:2). Only the Lord sees motives perfectly (1 Sam 16:7) and will bring all things to light when He returns (Rom 2:16).

Still, this does not silence discernment. Later Paul does judge sin within the church (1 Cor 5:3), but he does so by the Wisdom of the Spirit, not the wisdom of the world. Christ Himself commanded, “Judge with right judgment” (John 7:24). We are to examine actions by the fruit they bear (Matt 7:16) and by whether they align with the gospel’s transforming power (2 Cor 5:17).

Faithful servants live for the approval of One. They labor quietly, awaiting the day when hidden motives are revealed and every true steward hears, “Well done, good and faithful servant” (Luke 12:42–44; Matt 25:21).

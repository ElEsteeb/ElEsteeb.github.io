  “Do you not know that you are God’s temple and that God’s Spirit dwells in you? If anyone destroys God’s temple, God will destroy him. For God’s temple is holy, and you are that temple.” (1 Corinthians 3:16–17, ESV)
</div>

In the Old Covenant, the glory of God descended upon a specific place: a tabernacle in the wilderness, later a temple in Jerusalem. There, behind the veil, the presence of the Almighty rested. The people came to the temple to draw near to God. But in Christ, something far greater has occurred: the temple has moved. Through His death and resurrection, the veil was torn (Matthew 27:51), and the Spirit of God now dwells in His people. Wherever the church stands, there stands the temple of the living God.

Paul’s declaration is not about private spirituality, but about the gathered body of believers. The “you” here is plural, you all are God’s temple. Together, we form the dwelling place of His Spirit (Ephesians 2:21–22). Christ is the foundation, and we are living stones being built upon Him (1 Peter 2:5). This means that the holiness once reserved for a physical sanctuary is now expected among God’s people. The church is not a place we go, but a people among whom God lives.

Paul’s warning is sobering: “If anyone destroys God’s temple, God will destroy him.” To harm the church through pride, division, or false teaching is to defile what God has made sacred. The Spirit of God is indivisible. When believers strive for status or superiority, they attempt to divide what cannot be divided: the presence of God Himself. This is why Paul earlier asked, “Is Christ divided?” (1 Corinthians 1:13). To tear at the unity of the church is to strike at Christ’s own body.

Instead, believers are called to build one another up in humility and love. As Paul writes elsewhere, “Be devoted to one another in brotherly love. Outdo one another in showing honor” (Romans 12:10). The temple of God is marked not by competition, but by communion, not by self-glory, but by the glory of Christ. For the presence of God dwells not in buildings, but in His people, and His people are holy because He is holy.

“God’s temple is holy, and you are that temple.”

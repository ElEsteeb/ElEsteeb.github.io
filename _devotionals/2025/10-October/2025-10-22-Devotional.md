<div class="scripture">
  “These things God has revealed to us through the Spirit. For the Spirit searches everything, even the depths of God. For who knows a person’s thoughts except the spirit of that person, which is in him? So also no one comprehends the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God. Now we have received not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, that we might understand the things freely given us by God. And we impart this in words not taught by human wisdom but taught by the Spirit, interpreting spiritual truths to those who are spiritual.” (1 Corinthians 2:10–13, ESV)
</div>

The wisdom of God has never been hidden because He wished to keep His people in ignorance, but because no human mind could ever uncover it on its own. The Spirit of God alone searches and knows the depths of God, and He alone reveals them to those who believe. The “mystery” Paul speaks of is not an abstract truth or secret enlightenment, it is the gospel itself, the plan of salvation through the crucified Christ. This is the wisdom the world calls foolish, yet it is the very wisdom of God (1 Cor 1:23–24).

Through the Spirit, believers come to see what no eye could have seen and no heart could have imagined (1 Cor 2:9): that the Creator Himself would redeem His creation by becoming man, bearing sin, and granting righteousness as a gift. Just as Peter wrote that “men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit” (2 Pet 1:21), so we too depend on that same Spirit to understand what has been written.

Worldly wisdom, driven by pride and speculation, cannot grasp these things. It boasts in its intellect, but spiritual understanding begins with humility. The same Spirit who inspired Scripture illumines the heart to believe it. Therefore, Paul strips away all ground for boasting. The “spiritual” are not those who possess secret insight, but those who, humbled by grace, depend entirely on the Spirit of God to know the mind of Christ (Phil 2:5).

   "By faith Sarah herself received power to conceive, even when she was past the age, since she considered him faithful who had promised. Therefore from one man, and him as good as dead, were born descendants as many as the stars of heaven and as many as the innumerable grains of sand by the seashore." (Hebrews 11:11-12, ESV)

Sarah’s story is a powerful reminder that faith is not measured by how quickly it comes, but by whether it ultimately trusts the One who promises. In Genesis 18:12, Sarah laughed at the idea of bearing a child in her old age. Her initial response was disbelief—understandable given the natural impossibility of the situation. And yet, Hebrews 11 commends her faith. Why?

Because somewhere between the promise and its fulfillment, Sarah believed. She participated in the promise. She considered Him faithful who had promised (Hebrews 11:11). And God honored her not for how she started, but for how she responded in the end.

Jesus tells a parable in Matthew 21:28–31 of two sons. One says “I will not” when called to work, but later changes his mind and obeys. The other says “I will,” but never follows through. Jesus affirms the one who obeyed, even if it was after initial resistance. The lesson is clear: obedience that comes late is still obedience that pleases the Father.

Sarah is a witness to this truth. Her laughter turned into joy (Genesis 21:6). Her doubt gave way to faith. Though she and Abraham were "as good as dead," God brought life from them (Hebrews 11:12). And that life led to a people as numerous as the stars.

You may feel that you’ve hesitated too long, faltered too often, or missed your moment. But listen to the witness of Sarah: It is not too late to believe. Even if your past is full of laughter born of doubt, God can still birth joy from your life. His promises are not constrained by your failures.

“Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts.” – Hebrews 3:15

As long as it is called “Today,” there is time to respond in faith. Trust the One who promises. He is faithful. And He may yet do more than you could ask or imagine—even now.

Sarah, our fifth witness to faith delayed but true, still speaks. May we have ears to hear.

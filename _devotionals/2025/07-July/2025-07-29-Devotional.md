  “By faith he kept the Passover and sprinkled the blood, so that the Destroyer of the firstborn might not touch them.” (Hebrews 11:28, ESV)
</div>

The faith of Moses, remembered in Hebrews 11:28, takes us back to a terrifying and sacred night: the night of the first Passover. God had warned that every firstborn in Egypt would die unless the blood of a lamb marked the doorposts of a house. There was no prior example to lean on, no history to reference. Only a command: take a lamb, kill it, spread its blood on the doorframe... and trust that God will pass over you.

Imagine the fear that night. The same God who had sent nine plagues was now sending the final blow. And the only protection was obedience to a strange command: mark your door with blood. That required radical trust. It was not a ritual for ritual's sake, It was a visible sign of invisible faith. As Exodus 12:13 says, “The blood shall be a sign for you... and when I see the blood, I will pass over you.”

It wasn't their birthright or moral superiority that saved them, it was the blood. And so it is with us.

That lamb pointed forward to another Lamb: “Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!” (John 1:29) “Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed.” (1 Corinthians 5:7)

Just as the Israelites believed God's promise and acted in faith, we too must trust that the blood of Jesus is our only hope of salvation. The Israelites didn’t see what happened that night, they simply trusted. And we also are called to walk by faith, not by sight (2 Corinthians 5:7), believing that Jesus' blood truly saves.

When we die, we have no firsthand experience to rely on, no past precedent to reassure us. We only have a promise: “The blood of Jesus cleanses us from all sin.” (1 John 1:7) “There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.” (Romans 8:1)

The Israelites witnessed God's judgment fall on Egypt, and His mercy fall on them. God was both just and merciful. The same is true at the cross. “It was to show his righteousness at the present time so that he might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus.” (Romans 3:26)

Let the example of the Passover remind us: it is the blood that saves. Not religion, not good works, not heritage, but the blood of the Lamb. Just as Moses and the people acted by faith in the unseen promise, so we are called to put our full confidence in Christ alone. His blood still speaks. His blood still covers. His blood still saves.

The Israelites stand as witnesses of a faith that trusts in the blood of the Lamb for salvation still speak. May we have ears to hear.

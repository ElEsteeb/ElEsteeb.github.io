<div class="scripture">
   "Therefore, brothers, since we have confidence to enter the holy places by the blood of Jesus, by the new and living way that he opened for us through the curtain, that is, through his flesh, and since we have a great priest over the house of God, let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, with our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water. Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for he who promised is faithful." (Hebrews 10:19-23, ESV)

Life can be hard—very hard. And in the face of trials, our hearts can grow weary. But the writer of Hebrews reminds us of something profoundly comforting: Jesus not only died, but He was raised. He is not a relic of the past or a memory we honor. He is the living Savior who continues to bring us to God every day.

When Jesus offered Himself as the final sacrifice for sin, He didn’t just cover guilt temporarily. He tore open the veil—the very curtain that symbolized the barrier between God and man—through His own flesh. This “new and living way” gives us confident access to the Father, not based on our works, but based on Christ’s finished work.

And He lives still. As Hebrews 7:25 declares, "He always lives to make intercession for them." This is why our hope is more than wishful thinking. It is a living hope grounded in a living Christ (1 Peter 1:3).

Paul echoes this truth in Romans 8:32–34, reminding us that “He who did not spare his own Son but gave him up for us all, how will he not also with him graciously give us all things?” No accusation can stand against those Christ has justified. He died, was raised, and now intercedes for us from the right hand of God.

So we do not lose heart. Though the world presses in, Jesus says, “Take heart; I have overcome the world” (John 16:33). And Revelation 1:18 boldly declares: “I died, and behold I am alive forevermore, and I have the keys of Death and Hades.”

Let us therefore hold fast to our confession. Our hope is not in fleeting comforts or temporary relief. It is anchored in the eternal life of Jesus Christ—the one who died for us, rose again, and now lives to bring us into the very presence of God.

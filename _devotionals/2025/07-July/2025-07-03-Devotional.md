   "But when Christ appeared as a high priest of the good things that have come, then through the greater and more perfect tent (not made with hands, that is, not of this creation) he entered once for all into the holy places, not by means of the blood of goats and calves but by means of his own blood, thus securing an eternal redemption. For if the blood of goats and bulls, and the sprinkling of defiled persons with the ashes of a heifer, sanctify for the purification of the flesh, how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, purify our conscience from dead works to serve the living God." (Hebrews 9:11-14, ESV)
</div>

The writer of Hebrews paints a powerful contrast between the old covenant and the new: one was a shadow, the other the substance. One involved the blood of animals and the repetition of rituals; the other centers on the once-for-all sacrifice of the Son of God Himself. And with this contrast, the author invites us to ask: If the old ways had any power at all, how much more effective is Jesus?

This “how much more” logic is a recurring theme throughout the Bible. Jesus used it often to help us understand the generosity of the Father (Matthew 7:11; Luke 12:24). And now the author of Hebrews uses it to show us the immense worth of Christ’s work on our behalf. If the blood of bulls and goats allowed the high priest to enter God’s presence even only once a year, how much more does the perfect, unblemished blood of Jesus open the way for us, always?

Not only does Jesus bring us near to God, He does what the law could never do: He purifies our conscience. No religious performance, moral effort, or spiritual routine can clean the deep places of our hearts. These are all “dead works,” lifeless efforts to earn what only grace can give. But Christ, who offered Himself through the eternal Spirit, does cleanse us (entirely and eternally) so that we can serve the living God freely and joyfully.

Let this be your confidence today: Jesus has done infinitely more than anything you could do on your own. His work is better, His access is fuller, His redemption is eternal. Don’t settle for shadows. Walk boldly in the light of Christ, who is better in every way.

   “And just as it is appointed for man to die once, and after that comes judgment, so Christ, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time, not to deal with sin but to save those who are eagerly waiting for him.” ​(Hebrews 9:27–28, ESV)

The writer of Hebrews is building to a climax in chapter 9: Jesus is not merely a better priest, He is the final High Priest whose work is finished. His once-for-all sacrifice did not merely cover sin, it put it away (Hebrews 9:26). In contrast to the old covenant, where priests continually offered sacrifices for sins that could never truly be removed, Jesus offered Himself once, decisively defeating the power of sin.

And here's the good news: if sin has been put away by Christ’s sacrifice, then it no longer has the authority to enslave those who trust in Him. The guilt, the shame, the power: broken. We are no longer prisoners to sin and death. That endless treadmill of sacrifice under the Old Covenant pointed to the need for something greater. Jesus is that greater hope.

The writer then draws a sharp parallel. Just as man dies once and then faces judgment, Christ also appeared once to bear sin, and He will appear again. But this time, not to be judged, not to suffer, not to deal with sin again. His second appearance is to save those who are eagerly waiting for Him. He comes not as a victim, but as Victor and King.

This is the crux of our assurance: the Judge is also the One who died for us. As Paul writes, “Who shall bring any charge against God’s elect? It is God who justifies. Who is to condemn? Christ Jesus is the one who died—more than that, who was raised—who is at the right hand of God, who indeed is interceding for us” (Romans 8:33–34). He has already won. And now we rest in that victory.

In Jesus, we have a better Prophet who speaks from heaven, a better High Priest who offered Himself once for all, and a better King who judges with righteousness and mercy. He has overcome the world and by faith in Him, so have we (1 John 5:4).

This is why the new covenant is called rest (Hebrews 4:9–11). Because the battle has already been fought and won. Because the One who died is the One who reigns. And because He is coming again, not with wrath for those who trust Him, but with salvation.

Wait eagerly. Walk confidently. Advance in victory. Rest fully. Jesus is better.

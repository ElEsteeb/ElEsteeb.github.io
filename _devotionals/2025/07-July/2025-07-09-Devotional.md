   "And every priest stands daily at his service, offering repeatedly the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins. But when Christ had offered for all time a single sacrifice for sins, he sat down at the right hand of God, waiting from that time until his enemies should be made a footstool for his feet. For by a single offering he has perfected for all time those who are being sanctified. And the Holy Spirit also bears witness to us; for after saying, “This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, declares the Lord: I will put my laws on their hearts, and write them on their minds,” then he adds, “I will remember their sins and their lawless deeds no more.” Where there is forgiveness of these, there is no longer any offering for sin." (Hebrews 10:10-18, ESV)

In Hebrews 10:11–18, the writer continues unveiling the majesty of Jesus as our eternal High Priest and reigning King. Earthly priests stood daily, offering sacrifices that could never truly remove sin (v.11), but Jesus, having offered one perfect sacrifice, sat down at the right hand of God (v.12), His work completed, His reign begun. From that exalted position, He waits “until His enemies should be made a footstool for His feet” (v.13,  Psalm 110:1), reigning even now.

But Jesus’ sacrifice does more than cleanse: it perfects those who are being sanctified (v.14). The writer then cites Jeremiah 31:33–34, reminding us that under the new covenant, God's law is written on our hearts and minds. This isn’t mere external conformity: it is inward transformation. As Ezekiel also promised, God would give His people new hearts and His Spirit to cause them to walk in His ways (Ezekiel 36:26–27). This is realized in Christ, who empowers His people to desire and do God’s will (Philippians 2:13).

Then, subtly but powerfully, the writer invites us to see something deeper. In Jeremiah 31:37, God promises that the “offspring of Israel” shall never cease to be a nation before Him. While many assume this refers to ethnic Israel, the phrasing opens the door to a more profound fulfillment. As Paul teaches in Galatians 3:16, the true “offspring” is Christ, and in Galatians 3:29, those who belong to Christ are heirs with Him. Thus, Jesus is the true nation, and we who are in Him are members of that eternal people.

This aligns perfectly with 1 Peter 2:9: “But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation.” This nation (those in Christ) are called to make disciples of all nations (Matthew 28:18–20), as the nations stream to the mountain of the Lord to learn His ways (Isaiah 2:2–3, Micah 4:1–3). Jesus’ reign is expanding. His enemies are being subdued (Daniel 2:34-35, 44-45). And we, His covenant people, participate in His victory (Ephesians 2:6).

So take heart: if you are in Christ, you are not only forgiven, you are transformed (2 Corinthians 5:17, Revelation 21:5). You are part of a kingdom that cannot be shaken (Hebrews 12:28), a people empowered to do the will of God. Let His Word dwell in you richly, and walk confidently, knowing you are part of the everlasting nation of Christ.

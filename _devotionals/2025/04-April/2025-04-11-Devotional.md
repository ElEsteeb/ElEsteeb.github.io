  “Behold, I am coming like a thief! Blessed is the one who stays awake, keeping his garments on, that he may not go about naked and be seen exposed.” (Revelation 16:15, ESV)
</div>

Right in the midst of God’s judgment being poured out, this verse almost interrupts the narrative—yet it does so with purpose. This is the voice of Jesus, reminding His followers to stay alert and ready. The language of “staying awake” and “keeping garments on” was not random for first-century hearers. It mirrored the practice of the temple guard in Jerusalem, who were checked during their night shifts. If caught asleep once, the guard was beaten; if caught a second time, his clothes were burned—he was exposed and shamed.

In that tradition, we can see a specific prophetic warning to Jerusalem, home of the temple. The first time Rome came to Jerusalem under Vespasian, Judea was bruised but spared total destruction. When Nero died, Vespasian left to take the throne—and with him went the immediate threat. But when Titus returned later, the final judgment came. Jerusalem, like a sleeping guard caught unready, was exposed. The Temple—Jerusalem’s pride and heart—was utterly destroyed.

But Jesus had already warned His disciples in Luke 21:20-21, saying, “But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then know that its desolation has come near. Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains...” The faithful believers recognized Vespasian’s initial siege as the sign Jesus had foretold. They did not delay. While others may have interpreted the pause in Roman aggression as a victory, the Christians discerned the moment and acted. They fled Jerusalem before Titus returned. When the final wave of judgment came, they were already gone. They were the ones who had stayed awake. They had kept their garments—figuratively and spiritually—and were not exposed to wrath.

This verse reminds us that God’s judgment is just, and His mercy is timely. But we must always be alert. The world may seem stable for a season, but the call to live faithfully and proclaim the truth never pauses. The day of the Lord comes like a thief—and only those who are awake will be ready.

Let us live with eyes open, hearts prepared, and garments on—ready to flee the city of destruction and enter the eternal city of peace.

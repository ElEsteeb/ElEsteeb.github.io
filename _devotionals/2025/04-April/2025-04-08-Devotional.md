<div class="scripture">
  "The fourth angel poured out his bowl on the sun, and it was allowed to scorch people with fire. They were scorched by the fierce heat, and they cursed the name of God who had power over these plagues. They did not repent and give him glory." (Revelation 16:8–9, ESV)
</div>

As God's judgments unfold in Revelation, the fourth bowl brings a striking reversal. The sun—once a symbol of life and light—is now empowered to scorch. This mirrors the fourth trumpet (Revelation 8:12), but here the judgment intensifies. What was once dimmed is now burning. The world, having rejected the light of Christ, now suffers under a light that brings no comfort.

Rather than responding in repentance, those afflicted curse God. This is a devastating picture of hardened hearts. Scripture consistently shows us that suffering is meant to draw people back to God. Deuteronomy 28 warned Israel that if they abandoned the Lord, even the blessings of creation would turn against them. James reminds believers that trials are tools of spiritual maturity (James 1:2–4). But to those who hate God, even suffering becomes a reason for rebellion.

Jesus described this tragic reality in Luke 16:19–31, the parable of Lazarus and the rich man. Even faced with undeniable truth—even if someone were to rise from the dead—the hardened heart will not believe. The sun burns, but instead of humbling themselves, the people curse the One who controls it.

This passage is a stark warning, but also a powerful comfort. For the believer, trials are not purposeless. They are light afflictions preparing us for an eternal weight of glory (2 Corinthians 4:17). But to the rebellious, the light of God's truth becomes a consuming fire. (John 3:19-21)

As we proclaim the gospel, we proclaim both salvation and judgment. Suffering may expose the hearts of men—but in Christ, even the fiercest heat becomes refining, not destroying.

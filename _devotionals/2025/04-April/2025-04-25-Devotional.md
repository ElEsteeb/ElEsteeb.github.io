  “Then I fell down at his feet to worship him, but he said to me, ‘You must not do that! I am a fellow servant with you and your brothers who hold to the testimony of Jesus. Worship God.’ For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.” (Revelation 19:10, ESV)
</div>

John, overwhelmed by the vision he receives, falls at the feet of the angel who delivered it. The word translated “worship” here implies deep reverence—perhaps akin to how someone might bow before a king or dignitary, rather than idolatrous devotion. But the angel quickly corrects him, not harshly, but with a profound truth: “I am a fellow servant with you and your brothers.”

This is no small statement. The angel is placing himself on equal footing with John—and with the church. In a single sentence, the angel affirms a seismic shift in redemptive history. Under the Old Covenant, God’s message came through angels, prophets, and symbols. As Hebrews 2:2 and Galatians 3:19 remind us, the law was delivered through angels. But now? Now, we are the ones entrusted with God’s message.

Moses once longed that all of God's people might prophesy (Numbers 11:29). Joel foresaw a day when sons and daughters would speak God's Word. Peter, at Pentecost, declared that day had arrived (Acts 2:17). The Spirit now dwells in every believer. 1 John reminds us that we are all anointed (1 John 2:20), and 1 Peter 1:10–12 tells us that even angels longed to understand what is now revealed through us.

We, the church, now speak the testimony of Jesus—not merely as words about Him, but as His living body. He is the Spirit of prophecy. He is the Word made flesh, the fulfillment of every Old Testament whisper, every promise, every shadow.

Even more stunning is Paul’s declaration in 1 Corinthians 6:3 that we will judge angels. Ephesians 6 reminds us that we wage war not against flesh and blood but against spiritual powers. We are not passive observers in this cosmic battle. We are God’s messengers—His angeloi—sent to declare Christ’s reign to the nations.

Jesus said that among those born of women, none was greater than John the Baptist—but even the least in the Kingdom is greater than he (Luke 7:28). Why? Because all the prophets spoke until John (Matt. 11:13). Now, Christ has come, and we are in Him. The age of mystery has given way to fulfillment. 

And what is the spirit of prophecy? Not merely future-telling. Not mysticism. It is the testimony of Jesus. He is the center, the substance, and the subject of all revelation. As Habakkuk foretold, “The earth will be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord as the waters cover the sea.” Christ is that glory. The stone that the builders rejected (Matthew 21:42-43) is becoming the mountain that fills the whole earth (Daniel 2:34-35, 44-45)

Now, we go. We speak. We live as the prophetic people of God, proclaiming that Jesus is Lord, and that the New Covenant is here. The Old has passed away, the New has come. The Spirit is in us—and that Spirit is the Spirit of prophecy.

<div class="scripture">
   "After this I heard what seemed to be the loud voice of a great multitude in heaven, crying out, “Hallelujah! Salvation and glory and power belong to our God, for his judgments are true and just; for he has judged the great prostitute who corrupted the earth with her immorality, and has avenged on her the blood of his servants.” Once more they cried out, “Hallelujah! The smoke from her goes up forever and ever.” And the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped God who was seated on the throne, saying, “Amen. Hallelujah!” And from the throne came a voice saying, “Praise our God, all you his servants, you who fear him, small and great.”” (Revelation 19:1–5, ESV)
</div>

In this passage, John witnesses an awesome scene of celebration in heaven. The multitudes, the elders, and the four living creatures all join in exalting God for His righteous judgment. The “great prostitute” — Jerusalem under the Old Covenant, now corrupted by its rejection of the Messiah — has been judged, and heaven rejoices at God’s justice.

It is important to see this moment not merely as the end of something, but as the beginning of something new. The destruction of Jerusalem marked the final putting away of the Old Covenant system, the old "city of God" that had become a harlot. Now the path is being cleared for the New Covenant community — the New Jerusalem — to rise.

Heaven’s joy reminds us that God's judgments are not cruel or arbitrary; they are holy and necessary. God’s justice vindicates His people and upholds His promises. As Augustine reflected in The City of God, there is a profound difference between the earthly city — proud, corrupt, and rebellious — and the heavenly city, humble, righteous, and eternal.

Today, we are citizens of that New Jerusalem, called to live in light of the mercy and justice of our King. Let us rejoice that His salvation, glory, and power endure forever, as we proclaim His Kingdom that can never be shaken!

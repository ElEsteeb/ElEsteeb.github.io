<div class="scripture">
  Then I saw an angel standing in the sun, and with a loud voice he called to all the birds that fly directly overhead, “Come, gather for the great supper of God, to eat the flesh of kings, the flesh of captains, the flesh of mighty men, the flesh of horses and their riders, and the flesh of all men, both free and slave, both small and great.” And I saw the beast and the kings of the earth with their armies gathered to make war against him who was sitting on the horse and against his army. And the beast was captured, and with it the false prophet who in its presence had done the signs by which he deceived those who had received the mark of the beast and those who worshiped its image. These two were thrown alive into the lake of fire that burns with sulfur. And the rest were slain by the sword that came from the mouth of him who was sitting on the horse, and all the birds were gorged with their flesh. 
(Revelation 19:17-21, ESV)

In Revelation 19, John lifts our eyes to a staggering vision: Christ the King, riding forth with the armies of heaven, armed not with earthly weapons but with the sword of His mouth, the very Word of God. This moment echoes Ezekiel’s ancient prophecy (Ezekiel 39:17–20), a foreshadowing of God's decisive victory over every rebellion.

This is no future apocalypse. It is a reality unfolding now. Christ, having conquered sin, death, and the grave, leads His Church out of bondage as in a New Exodus—not to wander in rebellion, but to march into the world, bearing the banner of the Gospel. As the Lord once led Israel into Canaan, He now leads His Bride, clothed in fine linen, pure and bright, into every nation, tribe, and people.

The battle is fierce, but the weapons are divine. "The sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God" (Ephesians 6:17), slays the lies of the enemy and tears down strongholds. Empires rise and fall, false religions crumble, and worldly systems shatter under the power of Christ’s advance. Yet, unlike worldly wars, this conquest gives life—Christ's Word conquers not through bloodshed but by bringing dead hearts to life.

Throughout history, the Church has been Christ’s mighty army, moving across the world transforming cultures through the unstoppable Gospel. With every soul redeemed, every injustice challenged, and every idol cast down, the Kingdom of Christ expands.

The beast and the false prophet, the worldly powers and deceptive false religions, are destined for destruction. But Christ’s Word goes forth still, conquering, saving, and subduing. As Psalm 2 promises, the Son will inherit all nations, and "the knowledge of the glory of the LORD will cover the earth as the waters cover the sea" (Habakkuk 2:14).

We are not idle bystanders; we are soldiers in His ranks. We march not by might nor by power, but by His Spirit (Zechariah 4:6). With the armor of God fitted upon us, and the sword of the Spirit in our hands, we proclaim: The Kingdom of this world has become the Kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ, and He shall reign forever and ever! (Revelation 11:15)

Today, remember: you are part of the Great Conquest. Christ leads you. His Word equips you. His victory is certain. March onward!

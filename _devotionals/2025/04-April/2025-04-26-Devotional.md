<div class="scripture">
  "'Then I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse! The one sitting on it is called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he judges and makes war. His eyes are like a flame of fire, and on his head are many diadems, and he has a name written that no one knows but himself. He is clothed in a robe dipped in blood, and the name by which he is called is The Word of God. And the armies of heaven, arrayed in fine linen, white and pure, were following him on white horses. From his mouth comes a sharp sword with which to strike down the nations, and he will rule them with a rod of iron. He will tread the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God the Almighty. On his robe and on his thigh he has a name written, King of kings and Lord of lords.'" (Revelation 19:11-16, ESV)

Sometimes when you are in an unfamiliar place, it is nice to find a posted map of the place. Most reassuring is the pointer on that map that says, "You Are Here." 

Heaven opens, and the victorious King rides forth. Christ, Faithful and True, goes out conquering, not by the sword of men, but by the sharp Word from His mouth (Revelation 19:15). His name is inscribed: "King of kings and Lord of lords." He does not ride alone. Behind Him follow the armies of heaven, clothed in fine linen, white and pure—His redeemed people, the Church (cf. Revelation 19:14; Ephesians 5:27).

This vision echoes the Exodus: just as God went before Israel in a pillar of cloud and fire (Exodus 13:21), now Christ Himself leads His people across the world. The Great Commission is fulfilled under His banner: "Go therefore and make disciples of all nations... And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age" (Matthew 28:19–20). His presence is no distant promise—it is the very heartbeat of His conquering procession.

Throughout history, we have witnessed the steady advance of Christ’s Kingdom. When early Christians rescued exposed infants from Roman streets, when believers moved emperors to end gladiatorial games, when monks preserved knowledge through the darkness of the Middle Ages, when abolitionists fought to end the slave trade, and when missionaries planted schools, hospitals, and churches on distant shores, when we oppose evil ideologies throughout the world—all of it has been the forward march of Christ the King, through His people.

We do not conquer with worldly might but with the Gospel, the sword of the Spirit (Ephesians 6:17). Christ’s rule demands the allegiance of every nation, every tribe, every heart. As Daniel foresaw, the stone rejected by men has become the mountain that fills the whole earth (Daniel 2:35). His reign is not partial. “He must reign until He has put all His enemies under His feet” (1 Corinthians 15:25).

Today, we are not waiting for Christ to begin His conquest—we are living in the age of His victorious campaign. Every act of mercy, every word of truth spoken, every soul won to Him is a step in the parade of His triumph.

We follow Him, our Champion, our King, bearing His Word and shining His light until the knowledge of the Lord covers the earth as the waters cover the sea (Habakkuk 2:14).

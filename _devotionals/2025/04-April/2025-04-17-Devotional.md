<div class="scripture">
  "But the angel said to me, “Why do you marvel? I will tell you the mystery of the woman, and of the beast with seven heads and ten horns that carries her. The beast that you saw was, and is not, and is about to rise from the bottomless pit and go to destruction. And the dwellers on earth whose names have not been written in the book of life from the foundation of the world will marvel to see the beast, because it was and is not and is to come. This calls for a mind with wisdom: the seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman is seated; they are also seven kings, five of whom have fallen, one is, the other has not yet come, and when he does come he must remain only a little while. As for the beast that was and is not, it is an eighth but it belongs to the seven, and it goes to destruction. And the ten horns that you saw are ten kings who have not yet received royal power, but they are to receive authority as kings for one hour, together with the beast. These are of one mind, and they hand over their power and authority to the beast. They will make war on the Lamb, and the Lamb will conquer them, for he is Lord of lords and King of kings, and those with him are called and chosen and faithful.” (Revelation 17:7-14, ESV)

In Revelation 17:7–14, John is given an angelic explanation of the visions he has just witnessed. The beast John saw is described as one who "was, and is not, and is about to rise from the bottomless pit" (Revelation 17:8, ESV). This twisted formula echoes and mocks the divine name of God, "who is and who was and who is to come" (Revelation 1:8, ESV), revealing the beast as a counterfeit deity.

The seven heads are identified as seven hills, unmistakably pointing to Rome, the imperial center of power. They also symbolize seven kings, beginning with Julius Caesar. At the time of Revelation’s writing, five emperors had fallen, Nero was reigning, and Galba, who ruled only briefly, was soon to come. Yet even after Galba’s short reign and the chaos of the "year of four emperors," Rome would persist — wounded but not destroyed — as the eighth king continued the same corrupt rule.

The ten horns represent provincial rulers allied with the beast, sharing authority for "one hour" (Revelation 17:12, ESV), a stark reminder of the fleeting nature of worldly power. These rulers join together to make war on the Lamb, yet their efforts are destined to fail, for "the Lamb will conquer them" (Revelation 17:14, ESV).

This vision reveals God's view of human empires: beastly, violent, and temporary. They demand loyalty and promise security but ultimately lead to destruction. Jerusalem tragically chose to trust in Caesar rather than Christ, crying, "We have no king but Caesar" (John 19:15, ESV). We are warned here not to place our hope in earthly powers, but in the Lamb who conquers and whose kingdom alone endures forever.

Where is your trust today — in the kingdoms of man or in the eternal King?

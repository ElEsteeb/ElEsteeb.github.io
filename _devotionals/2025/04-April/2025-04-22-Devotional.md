  "Then I heard what seemed to be the voice of a great multitude, like the roar of many waters and like the sound of mighty peals of thunder, crying out, “Hallelujah! For the Lord our God the Almighty reigns." (Revelation 19:6, ESV)
</div>

The fall of the old Jerusalem was not the end of God's work, but a new beginning. In Revelation 19:6, John hears the triumphant voice of a great multitude—a roar like rushing waters and thunderous peals. This multitude is none other than the gathered people of God, not merely a remnant from Israel, but now a multitude from every tribe, nation, and tongue Revelation 7:9-10). Their song, "Hallelujah! For the Lord our God the Almighty reigns," proclaims the truth that has echoed since Christ’s resurrection: All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to Him (Matthew 28:18).

The sound of peals of thunder takes us back to Mount Sinai (Exodus 19:16, 19), when Israel first encountered the awesome voice of God. Now, it is not a physical mountain trembling, but the nations themselves responding to the voice of their King in the mouth of his people. The Old Covenant has been shaken and removed. What remains is the unshakable Kingdom of Christ (Hebrews 12:26-28).

This vision reminds us that the Church today—made up of believers from all nations—is called to continue this proclamation. As the multitude cries out, so we too are to announce that the Lord God Almighty reigns. The Great Commission to teach the nations to obey Christ (Matthew 28:19-20) is the outworking of this heavenly vision. Christ's reign is not distant or theoretical; it is real, active, and expanding through the faithful witness of His people.

May we join our voices with the multitude, declaring His reign in every word, every act of obedience, and every step of faith. As His kingdom advances among the nations, we are called to live and declare this truth boldly, fulfilling His commission with joy and confidence.

<div class="scripture">
  ""Therefore we must pay much closer attention to what we have heard, lest we drift away from it. For since the message declared by angels proved to be reliable, and every transgression or disobedience received a just retribution, how shall we escape if we neglect such a great salvation? It was declared at first by the Lord, and it was attested to us by those who heard" (Hebrews 2:1-3, ESV)
</div>

The world rarely pulls us away from God in a single, violent tug. Most of the time, it happens slowly, quietly. Like a boat loosed from its mooring, we begin to drift, not out of rebellion, but out of neglect. And the author of Hebrews warns us, "Pay much closer attention."

Jesus is not just one more messenger. He is the Son of God, the final and complete Word spoken to humanity (Hebrews 1:1–2). If even the Law, delivered through angels, carried weight and brought judgment when ignored, how much more should we listen when God Himself speaks through His Son?

We must never forget: the Word of God is not just true, it is alive (Hebrews 4:12). It is both anchor and compass. It does not change with the cultural tide. When we pay attention to His Word, we are tethered to the unchanging One, the same yesterday, today, and forever (Hebrews 13:8).

But distraction is everywhere. Our world is loud. Family, careers, causes, entertainment, natural disasters, even ministry: good things can become disordered when we stop tuning our hearts to Christ. When we are not aligned to him, our reflection of him is distorted. 

Psalm 1 describes the blessed one as someone who “meditates day and night” on God’s law, not as a hermit, but as a fruitful tree planted by streams of water. His life flows from the Word. He is nourished, grounded, and flourishing while others wither in the winds of change.

Church history confirms it, every time the church drifts, it is because it has stopped listening to the Word and started echoing the world.

So let this be our resolve: pay closer attention. Not because God’s Word is fragile, but because we are. Let us fix our eyes and hearts on Christ, the anchor of our souls (Hebrews 6:19), lest we silently, slowly drift.

<div class="scripture">
  "And, “You, Lord, laid the foundation of the earth in the beginning, and the heavens are the work of your hands; they will perish, but you remain; they will all wear out like a garment, like a robe you will roll them up, like a garment they will be changed. But you are the same, and your years will have no end.” And to which of the angels has he ever said, “Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet”? Are they not all ministering spirits sent out to serve for the sake of those who are to inherit salvation?"  (Hebrews 1:10-14, ESV)

Before there was anything, before light, space, or time, Jesus was. He is the one who laid the foundation of the earth, who stretched out the heavens like a canopy. This declaration from Hebrews echoes the truth of John 1: “All things were made through him.” It is a stunning claim: Jesus is not merely the King of Heaven, He is the Maker of all that exists.

And yet, everything that was made, no matter how majestic, will perish. Like a worn-out garment, the heavens and the earth will fade, but Jesus will remain. He is unchanging. Eternal. Untouched by time or decay.

The old world, marred by sin and groaning for renewal, is not the end of the story. Jesus changes it, “like a garment they will be changed.” “Behold, I am making all things new,” He declares in Revelation 21:5.

This isn’t just about future hope: it’s present reality. As 2 Corinthians 5:17 says, “If anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come.” The world is being remade, starting with hearts, souls, and lives reborn in Him.

The writer of Hebrews is pointing to the idea that Jesus is remaking the heavens and the earth. This terminology is again evocative of Revelation 6:12 where the sky itself is rolled up like a scroll here the writer says it's rolled up like a robe. The incarnation, life, death, and resurrection of Jesus is a cosmicly changing event. He does away with the old, and creates the new, the better. The old world was types and shadows, behold, the arrival of the pure, perfect, King of Heaven and Earth. The Father now speaks to us through His Son. We receive the Revelation of Jesus Christ.

The writer of Hebrews closes this chapter by quoting Psalm 110: “Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool.” Jesus is not waiting to reign, He reigns now. And as the eternal King, He is actively subduing evil and building a new creation where righteousness dwells, through his people.

So today, take comfort. Everything else may shift and crumble, but Jesus remains. The unchanging Creator is making all things new, and He will not fail.

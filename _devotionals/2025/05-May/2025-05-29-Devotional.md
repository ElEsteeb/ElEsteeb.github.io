  "While God also bore witness by signs and wonders and various miracles and by gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to his will." (Hebrews 2:4, ESV)
</div>

The majesty of Jesus, proclaimed in the opening chapter of Hebrews, is not left to speculation or philosophical musings. God Himself confirmed the message of the gospel with power: through signs, wonders, miracles, and the gifts of the Holy Spirit. These were not mere spectacles or tools for spiritual entertainment: they were divine affirmations that Jesus is who He claimed to be: God in the flesh.

Jesus didn’t make circular claims (“I am God because I say I am”), the Father bore witness to the Son. Nature obeyed Him. Demons fled. The dead were raised. And after His resurrection, the Holy Spirit empowered His people to testify boldly, with supernatural gifts attesting to the truth that God had spoken finally and fully in His Son (Hebrews 1:2).

But the writer of Hebrews is clear: these divine demonstrations were never meant to become ends in themselves. They weren’t toys to play with or proof of personal spirituality. They were validations of the once-for-all message. When the apostles preached Christ, God underscored their testimony, so that we might have no excuse for drifting away (Hebrews 2:1-3).

So beware, dear reader, of the endless chase for the “new.” This passage is both a validation of Jesus Divinity, and a warning against looking for someone who teaches something "new." Inevitably, false teachers understand that they need to produce miracles, and some seem to. But even in the claim, they  fail, because in teaching a "new revelation," they are be claiming to be a better "revealer" of God than Jesus himself, God in the flesh. As Hebrews 1:3 shows us, Jesus is the complete revelation of God.  Beware of those who claim updated revelations, visits to heaven, or secret teachings delivered by angels. As Paul warned, even if an angel preaches another gospel, let him be accursed (Galatians 1:8) and yet, how many false religions have been initiated from a supposed angel bringing a "new" revelation? Islam and Mormonism come to mind, as well as all those preachers who claim to regularly visit with angels, or are able to visit heaven, yet their message never complies with the Word of God.  There is no “fresher” truth than Jesus, and no greater sign than His death and resurrection.

God has already spoken. The signs have already borne witness. Christ is enough. There is no greater revelation than Jesus, there will never be. Let us pay careful attention.

<div class="scripture">
  "'And when the thousand years are ended, Satan will be released from his prison and will come out to deceive the nations that are at the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them for battle; their number is like the sand of the sea. And they marched up over the broad plain of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city, but fire came down from heaven and consumed them, and the devil who had deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and sulfur where the beast and the false prophet were, and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever." (Revelation 20:7-10, ESV)

In this climactic vision, John draws deeply from the Old Testament to paint a portrait of the final revolt against Christ’s Kingdom. The “thousand years” here are symbolic—a fullness of time in which the Church reigns with Christ (Revelation 20:4–6), fulfilling the Great Commission by discipling the nations (Matthew 28:18–20). Just as Psalm 50:10 declares God owns “the cattle on a thousand hills,” this period represents the complete age of the Church, not a literal duration.

John’s vision mirrors the Exodus story and the conquest of Canaan. As in Joshua 11:4–6, the enemies of God are gathered “as the sand that is on the seashore,” but God tells His people not to fear, for He will give them into their hands. Revelation 20 echoes this: Satan is released for a final deception, gathering “Gog and Magog”—a symbolic term from Ezekiel 38–39 representing all hostile nations—to war against the “beloved city,” the Church.

Yet this is not the end of God’s purposes—it is their consummation. Fire from heaven, the same judgment we see in Ezekiel 39:6 and reminiscent of Sodom and Gomorrah (Genesis 19:24), devours the attackers. God will decisively defend His people.

This revolt underscores a vital truth: Though the Gospel shall fill the earth as waters cover the sea (Habakkuk 2:14), and though Christ reigns through His Church, there remains a spiritual battle. As Ezekiel 47:11 shows, even in the glorious vision of a renewed land, “its swamps and marshes will not become fresh.” In other words, there will always be rebellious enclaves—hearts and systems that refuse to yield to Christ’s lordship.

Joshua’s conquest was incomplete because of Israel’s compromise. But Christ, the greater Joshua (the name "Jesus" means Joshua), will see His conquest through. The Church, like the Israelites of old, must remain vigilant, not lulled into complacency by worldly peace or superficial conversions. Many will profess allegiance, but not all are truly Christ’s (Matthew 7:21–23). The wheat and the tares grow together (Matthew 13:24–30). The final revolt will be driven by those who once appeared to belong.

Even so, the end is not in doubt. As 1 Corinthians 2:8 says, the rulers of this age “crucified the Lord of glory,” thinking they had won, but Christ triumphed over them in open shame (Colossians 2:15). At the last day, Satan’s final effort will meet the same fiery defeat.

Let us therefore live watchfully, advancing the Kingdom boldly with the sword of the Spirit, knowing that the Church will be surrounded, yet never overcome. The beloved city will stand—not by might, nor by power, but by the Spirit of the Lord (Zechariah 4:6). The serpent’s end is sealed. Glory to Christ the One True King.

<div class="scripture">
  "For it was not to angels that God subjected the world to come, of which we are speaking. It has been testified somewhere, “What is man, that you are mindful of him, or the son of man, that you care for him? You made him for a little while lower than the angels; you have crowned him with glory and honor, putting everything in subjection under his feet.” Now in putting everything in subjection to him, he left nothing outside his control. At present, we do not yet see everything in subjection to him. But we see him who for a little while was made lower than the angels, namely Jesus, crowned with glory and honor because of the suffering of death, so that by the grace of God he might taste death for everyone." (Hebrews 2:5-9, ESV)

Humanity was made for dominion. In Genesis 1:26–28, God gave mankind the charge to rule over every living thing. Psalm 8 celebrates this: “You have made him a little lower than the heavenly beings and crowned him with glory and honor.” But here’s the problem: we don’t see that kind of dominion in the world today. Instead, we see brokenness, weakness, and death. So what happened?

Hebrews 2 speaks into that tension. It affirms God’s purpose for humanity but acknowledges what we experience: "At present, we do not yet see everything in subjection to him.” We’ve fallen short of the glory for which we were made (Romans 3:23). Sin shattered our rule, and death dethroned us.

“But we see Him…”

We see Jesus.

Jesus, the eternal Son of God, who for a little while became lower than the angels, taking on our fragile humanity (Philippians 2:6–8). He stepped into the brokenness, not to simply observe it, but to conquer it. He tasted death for everyone, not to end His story, but to begin ours anew.

And now, He is crowned with glory and honor, not in spite of His death, but because of it. In Jesus, we see our true destiny fulfilled. He is the perfect human, the Second Adam (1 Corinthians 15:47-49) who reigns not only as God but also as Man. What we forfeited through sin, He regained through obedience. What we failed to subdue, He now holds in perfect authority.

The dominion promised to mankind finds its fulfillment in Him. And now, through faith in Christ, we are united with Him: sharing not only in His sufferings but also in His reign (2 Timothy 2:12; Revelation 3:21).

So take heart: though you may not yet see the world as it should be, look to Jesus. His crown was forged through suffering, and through Him, we are restored to the purpose for which we were made. The one who tasted death for us is now enthroned above all, and He has not forgotten us.

We don’t yet see all things under our feet:
But we see Jesus Christ. And Christ is enough.

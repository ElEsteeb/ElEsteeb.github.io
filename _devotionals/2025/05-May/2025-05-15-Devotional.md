  "No longer will there be anything accursed, but the throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it, and his servants will worship him. They will see his face, and his name will be on their foreheads. And night will be no more. They will need no light of lamp or sun, for the Lord God will be their light, and they will reign forever and ever." (Revelation 22:3–5, ESV)

The final verses of Revelation echo the restoration of Eden and the fulfillment of every covenant promise. “No longer will there be anything accursed,” because Christ has borne the curse for us. Paul writes, “Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us” (Gal. 3:13–14). Through the Cross, the way back to the Tree of Life has been opened. We no longer walk in exile from God but in communion with Him, because Christ became the accursed One so that we might become the blessed.

“They will see his face” (v. 4)—this phrase is not only a promise of physical vision but of deep, intimate fellowship. The priestly blessing in Numbers 6:24–26 longed for this: “The LORD make his face to shine upon you.” Now, that blessing is fully realized. Paul tells us, “Now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face” (1 Cor. 13:12). To see God's face is the fulfillment of relational closeness; it is the very heart of covenant love. Paul writes again, “We all, with unveiled face, beholding the glory of the Lord, are being transformed...from one degree of glory to another” (2 Cor. 3:18).

God’s name on our foreheads (Rev. 22:4) is the sealing of identity and obedience. What Israel was commanded in Deuteronomy 6—to bind the law to their hands and foreheads—is now fulfilled by the Spirit, who writes His law on our hearts (Jer. 31:33). We belong to Him.

And because He reigns, we reign with Him. As Paul says, “God...raised us up with him and seated us with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus” (Eph. 2:6). His light shines in our hearts now (2 Cor. 4:6), and even now, we walk in eternal life (John 17:3). Physical death is no longer a curse, but a transition from glory to greater glory.

Job declared, “I know that my Redeemer lives” (Job 19:25), and the hymn rightly proclaims, “Because He lives, I can face tomorrow.” Eternity is not something we merely wait for—it has begun in us. We live in Christ, and He lives in us. His reign has started, and so has ours. We are in the world, but not of it. We are eternal people, living now in the light of the Lamb.

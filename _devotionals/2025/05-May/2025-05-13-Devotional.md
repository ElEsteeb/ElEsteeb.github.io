<div class="scripture">
  "And the city has no need of sun or moon to shine on it, for the glory of God gives it light, and its lamp is the Lamb. By its light will the nations walk, and the kings of the earth will bring their glory into it, and its gates will never be shut by day—and there will be no night there. They will bring into it the glory and the honor of the nations. But nothing unclean will ever enter it, nor anyone who does what is detestable or false, but only those who are written in the Lamb’s book of life." (Revelation 21:23-27, ESV)

The vision of the New Jerusalem in Revelation 21 doesn’t only point us forward to heaven, it shines as a picture of the Church here and now, empowered by the Lamb and fulfilling the promises spoken by the prophets. Isaiah 60 foresaw a day when the nations would walk by God’s light, bringing their glory into Zion. Revelation takes up that vision and shows it fulfilled through the Lamb who is the lamp.

Peter declares that we are a “holy nation” (1 Peter 2:9), and Zechariah proclaims that “many nations shall join themselves to the Lord in that day” (Zechariah 2:11). These are not idle hopes, they are the unfolding of the Great Commission. Christ’s Kingdom is expanding. It is not in heaven only, for there are still nations outside the city, but it is heavenly in nature, radiating the light of Christ to the world.

Jesus entered the night of betrayal and death (John 13:30) and emerged victorious as the dawn of a new creation. The sun and moon are no longer our ultimate guides; now we walk by the light of the Lamb. As our High Priest, He walks among the lampstands (Rev. 1:12–13), preparing us, the Church, to shine in the darkness.

To conquer the night means to live in the day, to walk in righteousness, to overcome the beastly powers of corrupt religion and government (Rev. 13), and to hold fast to the promises to the conquerors (Rev. 2–3). Isaiah 35:8 calls it the Highway of Holiness, none but the redeemed shall walk there. Only those written in the Lamb’s book of life may enter.

But as the Church, we are not merely awaiting glory, we are called to participate in it. We reign with Christ not as tyrants, but as undershepherds (1 Pet. 5:2–4), bringing His justice, peace, and truth to every corner of the earth. We are the light of the world (Matt. 5:14). And as Christ’s light shines through us, every nation will one day bow and confess that He is Lord (Phil. 2:10–11).

Let us walk boldly in the day, reflecting the glory of our risen King, until the nations bring their glory into His city.

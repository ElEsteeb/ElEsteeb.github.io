  “And I saw no temple in the city, for its temple is the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb.” (Revelation 21:22, ESV)
</div>

In the visions of Ezekiel and Zechariah, the temple stood as the centerpiece of prophetic hope—a structure meticulously measured, symbolizing God's dwelling among His people (Ezek. 40:1–5; Zech. 2:1–5). John, too, was commanded earlier in Revelation to measure the temple (Rev. 11:1), marking out the place of divine presence and protection. But here in Revelation 21:22, we encounter a glorious surprise: there is no temple in the New Jerusalem. Why? Because “its temple is the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb.”

This is the fulfillment of Jesus’ words to the Samaritan woman: “The hour is coming when neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father… the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth” (John 4:21–24). Worship is no longer tethered to a building, but flows from our union with the indwelling God.

Peter tells us that the prophets of old searched and inquired carefully about the grace now revealed to us, things “into which angels long to look” (1 Peter 1:10–12). What was once hidden in mystery has now been openly revealed in Jesus Christ: God’s dwelling place is with man (Rev. 21:3). Not in a temple made by human hands, but in the body of Christ—both His physical body and His church, the new temple (1 Cor. 3:16; Eph. 2:19–22).

Paul rejoices in this reality, declaring, “We all, with unveiled face, beholding the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from one degree of glory to another” (2 Cor. 3:18). The veil has been torn (Matt. 27:51), and in Christ, heaven and earth are joined. He is both our high priest and our temple (Heb. 8:1–2), and through Him we boldly enter God’s presence (Heb. 10:19–22).

Let us then live as citizens of this heavenly city—worshiping in spirit and truth, proclaiming the Gospel, and advancing the Kingdom. 

Once the disciples excitedly pointed out to Jesus the glory of the temple (Matt. 24:1-2), what great excitement should we have to point out this greater degree of glory (2 Cor. 3:11): the temple not made by human hands (1 Cor. 3:16-17, Eph. 2:22), the eternal dwelling place, God and man in unity (Col. 2:6-7, Col. 1:26-27), in the one man, Jesus Christ! (Rom. 5:12-21, 1 Timothy 2:5)

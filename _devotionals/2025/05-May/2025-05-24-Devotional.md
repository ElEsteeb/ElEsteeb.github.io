<div class="scripture">
  "And again, when he brings the firstborn into the world, he says, “Let all God’s angels worship him.” Of the angels he says, “He makes his angels winds, and his ministers a flame of fire.” But of the Son he says, “Your throne, O God, is forever and ever, the scepter of uprightness is the scepter of your kingdom. You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness; therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness beyond your companions.” (Hebrews 1:6-9, ESV)

At every point in Hebrews 1, the writer lifts our eyes higher. In verses 6–9, we see heaven's response to the incarnation: angels, those radiant and powerful beings, commanded to worship the newborn Christ. Though their presence often struck fear into men, they themselves bowed before the child in the manger, recognizing Him not as a peer, but as Lord.

Luke 2:11 declares it plainly: “For unto you is born… a Savior, who is Christ the Lord.” The angels were not only messengers at Jesus’ birth—they were witnesses to the arrival of the One they worship in glory. The writer of Hebrews reminds us that angels are like winds and flames, servants of God's will. But Jesus? He is no mere servant. He is “God,” enthroned forever.

In these verses, we are invited into the mystery of the Trinity. The Father speaks of the Son with divine language: “Your throne, O God, is forever and ever.” And yet He also says, “God, your God, has anointed you.” Jesus is fully God, and yet distinct from the Father. Not divided in essence, not confused in personhood, this is the unity of the Trinity: Father, Son, and Spirit.

Psalm 45, quoted here, originally celebrated an earthly king. But its true fulfillment was always in the King of kings. Jesus, who loves righteousness and hates wickedness, is anointed “with the oil of gladness beyond [his] companions.” He is not merely a better man or holier angel. He is categorically higher: God and Man, the bridge between heaven and earth. 

So let us marvel. Angels worship Him. God calls Him God. Righteousness is His delight, and everlasting dominion is His inheritance. This is Jesus: the anointed, enthroned, eternal Son.

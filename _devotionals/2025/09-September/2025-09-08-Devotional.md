  “Do not repay evil for evil or reviling for reviling, but on the contrary, bless, for to this you were called, that you may obtain a blessing. For, “Whoever desires to love life and see good days, let him keep his tongue from evil and his lips from speaking deceit; let him turn away from evil and do good; let him seek peace and pursue it. For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous, and his ears are open to their prayer. But the face of the Lord is against those who do evil.” Now who is there to harm you if you are zealous for what is good? But even if you should suffer for righteousness’ sake, you will be blessed. Have no fear of them, nor be troubled, but in your hearts honor Christ the Lord as holy, always being prepared to make a defense to anyone who asks you for a reason for the hope that is in you; yet do it with gentleness and respect, having a good conscience, so that, when you are slandered, those who revile your good behavior in Christ may be put to shame. For it is better to suffer for doing good, if that should be God’s will, than for doing evil.” (1 Peter 3:9–17, ESV)

Peter shows us that the Christian life speaks in two voices: our conduct and our confession. First, our conduct demonstrates that Christ is better. When wronged, we do not retaliate. When reviled, we bless. This reflects the way of Jesus, who “when he was reviled, he did not revile in return” (1 Peter 2:23). By refusing to mirror the world’s hostility, we reveal the reality of a new life within us. As Paul says, “Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good” (Romans 12:21).

But Peter also makes clear that our conduct alone is not enough. Our confession must follow. “In your hearts honor Christ the Lord as holy, always being prepared to make a defense to anyone who asks you for a reason for the hope that is in you” (v. 15). The defense (apologia) is not a courtroom speech, it is the believer’s everyday readiness to explain why we hope in Christ, even in suffering. This is not about winning arguments but bearing witness to the risen Lord.

Notice, however, how Peter insists this be done: “with gentleness and respect.” Our words must match the grace of our lives. Harshness can betray the very gospel we proclaim. Gentleness is not weakness; it is strength under control, shaped by Christ, “gentle and lowly in heart” (Matthew 11:29). A soft answer turns away wrath (Proverbs 15:1), and gracious speech makes the truth beautiful (Colossians 4:6).

In conduct and in confession, in blessing and in defending, we show that Christ is better. And when suffering comes, we entrust ourselves to God, knowing “it is better to suffer for doing good, if that should be God’s will, than for doing evil” (v. 17).

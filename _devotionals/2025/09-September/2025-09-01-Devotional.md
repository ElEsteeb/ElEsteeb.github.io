  “Be subject for the Lord's sake to every human institution, whether it be to the emperor as supreme, or to governors as sent by him to punish those who do evil and to praise those who do good. For this is the will of God, that by doing good you should put to silence the ignorance of foolish people. Live as people who are free, not using your freedom as a cover-up for evil, but living as servants of God. Honor everyone. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the emperor.” (1 Peter 2:13–17, ESV)

In 1948, during Communist rule in Romania, Lutheran pastor Richard Wurmbrand was arrested for preaching Christ in a state that declared itself atheist. He later recalled:

“It was strictly forbidden to preach to the other prisoners. Whoever was caught doing this received a severe beating. A number of us decided to pay the price for the privilege of preaching. We accepted their terms: we preached, and they beat us. We were happy preaching; they were happy beating us. So everyone was happy.”

This story captures Peter’s paradoxical command: live as free people by submitting to authority. Peter does not call believers to rebellion but to a deeper allegiance, to God Himself. Even unjust rulers are placed by God (Dan 2:21; Rom 13:1–2). Submission is not passive surrender but an act of worship, demonstrating confidence in God’s sovereignty.

Peter’s own journey adds weight to his words. Once quick to draw a sword (John 18:10) and rebuke Jesus (Matt 16:22), he now exhorts believers to follow Christ’s example: “When he was reviled, he did not revile in return… but continued entrusting himself to him who judges justly” (1 Pet 2:23). Submission does not mean silence. Acts 5:29 reminds us that we must obey God rather than men, even when it costs us dearly.

History proves this truth: kingdoms that persecuted God’s people: Babylon, Rome, Soviet regimes, have all fallen. God’s kingdom alone endures (Dan 7:14). Our faithful witness, even under oppression, becomes the litmus test of a nation’s moral fabric. We submit to rulers not because they are perfect, but because Christ reigns over them. Our posture toward authority reveals whether we truly trust God’s rule. 

Are we willing to follow Christ’s example, enduring injustice with courage, proclaiming truth without rebellion? True freedom is not found in overthrowing governments but in living as servants of the King whose kingdom has no end.

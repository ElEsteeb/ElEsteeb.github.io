<div class="scripture">
  “Therefore I intend always to remind you of these qualities, though you know them and are established in the truth that you have. I think it right, as long as I am in this body, to stir you up by way of reminder, since I know that the putting off of my body will be soon, as our Lord Jesus Christ made clear to me. And I will make every effort so that after my departure you may be able at any time to recall these things.” (2 Peter 1:12–15, ESV)

Peter writes as a spiritual father, carrying what we might call three burdens.

First, he bears the burden to remind. Though his readers already know the truth, he repeats it for their safety (Philippians 3:1; Jude 1:5). Faith is not maintained by chasing new revelations but by returning again and again to what God has already said. As Moses commanded Israel, “Take care lest you forget the LORD” (Deuteronomy 6:12). Forgetting is the first step toward falling away, so Peter’s repetition is an act of love.

Second, Peter carries the burden of mortality. Jesus had told him that his death was near (John 21:18–19), and that knowledge gave urgency to his words. Like Paul, who wrote near his own departure that he had “fought the good fight” (2 Timothy 4:6–8), Peter does not waste his remaining time. His concern is not for his own legacy but for the endurance of the church.

Third, he shoulders the burden of stewardship. Unlike false teachers who use people to build their own name (2 Peter 2:1–3), Peter sees himself as a servant whose task is to build up others. He is a foundation stone laid upon Christ, the cornerstone (Ephesians 2:20). His teaching, even written here, is meant to keep believers anchored in Jesus long after he departs.

For Peter, both living and dying serve one end: that God’s people would remain steadfast in Christ, never forgetting the truth that saves. And so should we: learning from his example, we too should live with the same purpose: to strengthen others in Christ so that, long after we are gone, the truth remains alive in their hearts.

  “The end of all things is at hand; therefore be self-controlled and sober-minded for the sake of your prayers. Above all, keep loving one another earnestly, since love covers a multitude of sins. Show hospitality to one another without grumbling. As each has received a gift, use it to serve one another, as good stewards of God’s varied grace: whoever speaks, as one who speaks oracles of God; whoever serves, as one who serves by the strength that God supplies—in order that in everything God may be glorified through Jesus Christ. To him belong glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen.” (1 Peter 4:7–11, ESV)

Peter reminds us that the Christian life is not a passive existence, but a vibrant calling. “The end of all things is at hand” (v.7). Because the Lord is near, our lives must be marked by watchfulness and prayer (Rom. 13:11–12; James 5:8). This readiness is not grim waiting but active service for the King who is worthy of all glory.

At the heart of this life is love: “Above all, keep loving one another earnestly, since love covers a multitude of sins” (v.8). Love does not mean ignoring sin, but rather bearing with one another in grace, forgiving as Christ has forgiven us (Prov. 10:12; Col. 3:13–14). Love binds us together as Christ’s body, keeping us from splintering apart.

Peter gives tangible examples of how this love is lived out. “Show hospitality to one another without grumbling” (v.9). Hospitality is not an optional extra; it is a way of receiving our brothers and sisters as Christ Himself (Rom. 12:13; Heb. 13:2). Whether opening our homes, sharing our tables, or lending our resources, we serve because God has so richly served us.

Then Peter broadens the vision: “As each has received a gift, use it to serve one another” (v.10). Every Christian is entrusted with grace for the good of others. Those who speak must do so as though God Himself were speaking (2 Tim. 3:16; 2 Cor. 5:20). Those who serve must rely not on their own strength but on the strength God provides (Col. 1:29). In both word and deed, we live out the reality that Christ is Lord.

Finally, Peter shows us the true aim: “in order that in everything God may be glorified through Jesus Christ” (v.11). The goal is not simply to maintain a “well-run” community, but that our lives of prayer, love, hospitality, teaching, and service would resound to the glory of God (1 Cor. 10:31; Jude 24–25). To Him belong all glory and dominion forever.

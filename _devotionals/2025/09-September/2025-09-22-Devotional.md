  “His divine power has granted to us all things that pertain to life and godliness, through the knowledge of him who called us to his own glory and excellence, by which he has granted to us his precious and very great promises, so that through them you may become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped from the corruption that is in the world because of sinful desire.” (2 Peter 1:3–4, ESV)
</div>

Peter wastes no time easing his readers into this letter. He begins with a declaration as weighty as anything written by John or Paul: Jesus’ power is divine. This is no mere teacher or prophet, this is God Himself, supplying His people with everything necessary for both eternal life and present godliness (John 1:1–4; Colossians 2:9). In case anyone doubted whether the apostles proclaimed the deity of Christ, here is Peter’s clear testimony.

But notice how these blessings come: not through human effort, philosophy, or mystical secrets, but through the knowledge of Him who calls us. Jesus Himself said, “You did not choose me, but I chose you” (John 15:16). By His own glory and excellence, He calls us into a life that reflects His character (Romans 8:29). This is why Jeremiah’s prophecy is fulfilled in Christ: “They shall all know me” (Jeremiah 31:34). The knowledge of God is not the achievement of the wise but the gift of the Savior.

And this gift is not shallow. By His glory, we are granted “precious and very great promises” promises of forgiveness (Hebrews 8:12), eternal life (John 3:16), the Spirit’s indwelling (John 14:16–17), and the hope of resurrection (1 Thessalonians 4:14). These promises are transformative, not merely comforting. They make us “partakers of the divine nature” (Galatians 2:20; 1 John 3:2). As Christ shared in our humanity (Hebrews 2:14–18), so we share in His holiness and eternal life.

This means we are not second-class citizens in God’s kingdom. Every believer (whether new or seasoned) receives the same Christ, the same Spirit, the same sufficiency. False teachers may whisper that you lack some hidden wisdom or deeper experience, but Peter says otherwise: in Christ you already have all things that pertain to life and godliness. The Christian life is not built on man but on Jesus alone.

To share in Christ’s life is also to leave corruption behind. “Our old self was crucified with him” (Romans 6:6). By His promises, we are not only forgiven: we are freed, set apart to live as those who belong to Him.

Christ is enough. He is the foundation, the sustenance, and the goal. Everything flows from Him, and everything leads back to Him.

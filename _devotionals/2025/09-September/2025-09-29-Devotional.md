<div class="scripture">
  “And we have the prophetic word more fully confirmed, to which you will do well to pay attention as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts, knowing this first of all, that no prophecy of Scripture comes from someone’s own interpretation. For no prophecy was ever produced by the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.” (2 Peter 1:19–21, ESV)

Peter had just described the Transfiguration, a moment of divine glory that few human eyes ever witnessed (2 Peter 1:16–18). Yet, astonishingly, he points us to something “more fully confirmed” than even that experience: the prophetic Word of God. In this, Peter shows humility, refusing to center authority on himself or his experience, and instead grounding it in Scripture.

The authority of Scripture rests not in the skill of its human writers, but in its divine origin. As Peter states, “no prophecy was ever produced by the will of man” (v. 21). The prophets did not invent their messages, nor did they interpret God’s purposes on their own. They were “carried along by the Holy Spirit.” This truth is echoed in Paul’s words: “All Scripture is breathed out by God” (2 Timothy 3:16). What we hold in our hands when we open the Bible is not the mere record of men, but the very Word of God Himself.

Because of this, Peter calls us to “pay attention” to the Word “as to a lamp shining in a dark place” (v. 19). In this present world of confusion and sin, Scripture provides the only sure light. Just as Psalm 119:105 declares, “Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path,” so we walk by this lamp until “the day dawns and the morning star rises” a reference to Christ Himself, the Bright Morning Star (Revelation 22:16).

Paul reminds us in 1 Corinthians 13:9–12 that our knowledge and prophecy are partial now, but one day we will see face to face. Until then, the lamp of God’s Word guides us, shaping us into the likeness of Christ (Romans 8:29). The Bible is not a human book to be debated like any other: it is the Spirit’s voice, confirmed and shining, carrying us until Christ Himself dawns in us fully in glory.

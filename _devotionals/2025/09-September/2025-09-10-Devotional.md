<div class="scripture">
  “Since therefore Christ suffered in the flesh, arm yourselves with the same way of thinking, for whoever has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin, so as to live for the rest of the time in the flesh no longer for human passions but for the will of God. For the time that is past suffices for doing what the Gentiles want to do, living in sensuality, passions, drunkenness, orgies, drinking parties, and lawless idolatry. With respect to this they are surprised when you do not join them in the same flood of debauchery, and they malign you; but they will give account to him who is ready to judge the living and the dead. For this is why the gospel was preached even to those who are dead, that though judged in the flesh the way people are, they might live in the spirit the way God does.” (1 Peter 4:1-6, ESV)

Peter calls us to adopt the very mindset of Christ, who willingly suffered in the flesh so that He might bring us to God (1 Pet 3:18). To “arm” ourselves (hoplisasthe, 1 Pet 4:1) is military language, reminding us that life in Christ is not passive but a battle against sin. Suffering for His sake demonstrates that we have broken with sin’s dominion (pepautai, “ceased,” Rom 6:6–11).

This produces a radical reorientation of life: “so as to live for the rest of the time in the flesh no longer for human passions but for the will of God” (1 Pet 4:2). Paul speaks similarly: “It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me” (Gal 2:20). Each moment is precious, “Behold, now is the favorable time” (2 Cor 6:2).

Peter contrasts this new life with the old: “sensuality, passions, drunkenness, orgies, drinking parties, and lawless idolatry” (1 Pet 4:3). The time for such things, he says, is more than enough. Our former companions may be surprised and malign us when we do not join them in what Peter calls a “flood of debauchery” (anachusis asōtias, 4:4). The word literally describes a torrent or overflowing, Peter is intentionally echoing the flood of Noah (1 Pet 3:20–21). Just as the ark carried Noah’s family through the waters of judgment, so Christ is our Ark, bearing us safely through the flood of sin. To leap into that torrent is to abandon the only vessel of salvation.

But there is also a sobering reminder: “They will give account to him who is ready to judge the living and the dead” (1 Pet 4:5). Human scorn is temporary, but God’s judgment is eternal (Acts 10:42; 2 Tim 4:1). Better to be judged and maligned by men now, and live in the Spirit, than to be swept into eternal death.

Finally, Peter anchors this hope: “For this is why the gospel was preached even to those who are dead” (1 Pet 4:6). Why to the dead? Because all are born dead in trespasses and sins (Eph 2:1). The gospel cannot come to the spiritually alive, for there are none; it comes only to the dead, so that by believing, they might “live in the spirit the way God does” (1 Pet 4:6). Though judged in the flesh like all people, those who receive Christ are raised to new life in the Spirit (Rom 8:10–11; Col 2:13).

Thus, today, while it is still called today (Heb 4:7), let us turn from sin, endure suffering, and cling to Christ our Ark. For though the flesh is judged, in Him we live by the Spirit (Rom 8:9–11).

  “For if these qualities are yours and are increasing, they keep you from being ineffective or unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. For whoever lacks these qualities is so nearsighted that he is blind, having forgotten that he was cleansed from his former sins.” (2 Peter 1:8-9, ESV)
</div>

Peter reminds us that the grace of God is not passive. The forgiveness and cleansing we have received in Christ are never meant to leave us unchanged. Instead, they call us into a life of growth and fruitfulness. He writes, “For if these qualities are yours and are increasing, they keep you from being ineffective or unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ” (2 Peter 1:8). The “qualities” he refers to, faith, virtue, knowledge, self-control, steadfastness, godliness, brotherly affection, and love (vv.5–7), are not optional extras. They are the very evidence of a living faith.

If these virtues are present, we will not be barren, but fruitful in our knowledge of Christ. Jesus Himself said, “Whoever abides in me and I in him, he it is that bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing” (John 15:5). Growth and fruitfulness are proof that we are abiding in Him. On the other hand, Peter warns that whoever lacks these qualities is spiritually shortsighted, even blind, having forgotten that he was cleansed from former sins (2 Peter 1:9). Forgetfulness of grace leads to stagnation and pride.

This blindness resembles the error of false teachers who boast in freedom while remaining slaves to corruption (2 Peter 2:19). They treat God’s promises as a license for arrogance rather than a call to humility. But Scripture is clear: “You were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ” (1 Corinthians 6:11). To forget this cleansing is to live as if Christ’s sacrifice had no effect.

For us, the call is both theological and practical. Grace compels diligence. It is not because we are better than others that we have received God’s gifts, but because Christ has made us His own (Philippians 3:12). Therefore, we hold His grace with open hands, living out these qualities in humility and love, and inviting others to share in the life that is found only in Him.

<div class="scripture">
  “So I exhort the elders among you, as a fellow elder and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, as well as a partaker in the glory that is going to be revealed: shepherd the flock of God that is among you, exercising oversight, not under compulsion, but willingly, as God would have you; not for shameful gain, but eagerly; not domineering over those in your charge, but being examples to the flock. And when the chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the unfading crown of glory.” (1 Peter 5:1–4, ESV)

Peter, having spoken much about suffering and refining fire, now turns his attention to the leadership of the church. He exhorts elders not as a distant authority, but as a “fellow elder and a witness of the sufferings of Christ” (1 Peter 5:1). This humility sets the tone: leadership in Christ’s church is never about power for its own sake, but about shepherding the flock that belongs to God.

Pastors and elders are to teach not only with their words but also with their lives. Paul echoed this when he urged believers to “imitate me, as I imitate Christ” (1 Corinthians 11:1). James warned that “not many of you should become teachers… for you know that we who teach will be judged with greater strictness” (James 3:1). If the refining fire tests the church as a whole (1 Peter 4:17), it will test leaders all the more, since they are called to be examples.

The qualifications for an elder in 1 Timothy 3:1–7 and Titus 1:5–9 are not arbitrary; they reflect Christ Himself. To be sober-minded, gentle, hospitable, and able to teach is to model the character of the Chief Shepherd (John 10:11). Leadership in Christ’s kingdom rejects worldly patterns of dominance and manipulation. Jesus said plainly, “The rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them… it shall not be so among you” (Matthew 20:25–26). Instead, elders are to serve eagerly, willingly, and humbly (1 Peter 5:2–3).

This passage is also a call to the flock. Believers must discern and appoint men who embody Christlike character, and keep them accountable to their calling. Hebrews reminds us that leaders “are keeping watch over your souls, as those who will have to give an account” (Hebrews 13:17). Faithful shepherds bear this burden, but the church bears responsibility in supporting and following leaders who reflect Christ.

Yet this weighty calling carries great hope. Peter promises that “when the chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the unfading crown of glory” (1 Peter 5:4). Though elders often labor unseen and without earthly praise, Christ Himself sees their faithfulness. The true Shepherd will one day honor His undershepherds, not with fading crowns of human approval, but with eternal reward.

So let elders examine themselves: are they modeling Christ in both word and deed? Let the flock seek out and uphold such men, encouraging them as they bear this holy trust. For in the end, it is Christ’s church, Christ’s sheep, and Christ’s glory that all faithful shepherding points to.

>**Revelation 3:20-22 ESV**
>"Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and eat with him, and he with me. [21] The one who conquers, I will grant him to sit with me on my throne, as I also conquered and sat down with my Father on his throne. [22] He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.’”

These words from Jesus are often used in evangelism, but they were spoken to the church in Laodicea. This wasn’t a call to salvation but an invitation to renewed fellowship. The Laodiceans had become lukewarm—neither hot nor cold—self-satisfied and unaware of their spiritual poverty (Revelation 3:15-17). Yet, Jesus had not abandoned them. Instead, He stood outside, knocking, desiring to be welcomed back into intimate communion with His people.

The imagery of Jesus dining with His followers speaks of deep, personal fellowship. In ancient culture, sharing a meal was an act of closeness and trust. This is what Christ longs for with His church—not distant acknowledgment but a vibrant, daily relationship. His knocking is persistent, His invitation open. 

For those who heed His voice, Jesus promises victory. The one who conquers—who resists spiritual complacency and embraces renewed fellowship—will reign with Him. This is a call to the church today as much as it was to Laodicea. If you have found yourself distant from Christ, distracted by self-sufficiency or worldly concerns, He is near. Open the door, let Him in, and enjoy the fullness of His presence once more!

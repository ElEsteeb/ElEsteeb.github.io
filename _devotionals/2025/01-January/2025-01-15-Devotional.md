>**Revelation 2:14-16 ESV**
>"But I have a few things against you: you have some there who hold the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to put a stumbling block before the sons of Israel, so that they might eat food sacrificed to idols and practice sexual immorality. [15] So also you have some who hold the teaching of the Nicolaitans. [16] Therefore repent. If not, I will come to you soon and war against them with the sword of my mouth."

Unlike his portrayal by many liberal preachers, Jesus does not tolerate other beliefs. Jesus rebukes the church in Pergamum for tolerating false teachings that led to idolatry and immorality. The teachings of Balaam and the Nicolaitans encouraged compromise with the world, violating God’s command for holiness. Jesus does not tolerate things that contradict the truth. Instead, He calls His people to uphold purity and reject worldly influences that corrupt their faith.

Jesus’ authority to judge and cleanse His people is emphasized throughout Revelation. In Revelation 1:13-16, He is depicted as the exalted Son of Man with eyes like fire and a sharp two-edged sword from His mouth, symbolizing His power to expose sin and execute judgment. In Revelation 2:16, He warns that unrepentant sin will be met with swift action. His holiness demands purity in His church, and His Word—alive and active—both convicts and restores those who repent.

Christ’s call to repentance is a loving invitation to be cleansed and restored to holiness. Throughout Scripture, God commands His people to be set apart (Leviticus 19:2; Hebrews 12:14). Repentance is the path to alignment with His will. By turning from sin and submitting to Christ’s authority, believers reflect His character and stand as a light in a dark world.

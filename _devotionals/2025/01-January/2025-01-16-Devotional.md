>**Revelation 2:17 ESV**
>"He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To the one who conquers I will give some of the hidden manna, and I will give him a white stone, with a new name written on the stone that no one knows except the one who receives it."

Jesus' promise to the one who conquers begins with the "hidden manna," a symbol of God’s provision and presence. Just as He sustained the Israelites with manna in the wilderness (Exodus 16:14-15), Christ sustains us spiritually as the Bread of Life (John 6:35). This manna is "hidden" because it is reserved for those who seek Him daily, trusting Him to meet their deepest needs. In a world that offers fleeting satisfaction, Jesus alone satisfies the hunger of our souls (Matthew 4:4).

The "white stone" represents forgiveness and acceptance. In ancient courts, a white stone signified acquittal, and in social contexts, it served as an invitation to special events. Through Christ’s sacrifice, we are acquitted of sin (Romans 8:1) and invited to the marriage supper of the Lamb (Revelation 19:9). This stone is a tangible reminder of our secure place in God’s kingdom, a gift not earned by our merit but freely given through grace (Ephesians 2:8-9).

On the stone is a "new name" known only to the one who receives it, reflecting the intimate relationship God offers each believer. This name signifies our transformation in Christ (2 Corinthians 5:17) and speaks of how He sees us—redeemed, beloved, and chosen (Isaiah 62:2). It is a deeply personal gift that assures us of our unique identity and purpose in Him. As you walk faithfully with Jesus, remember that you are not defined by the world’s labels but by the name God has given you.

Christ calls us to perseverance, promising eternal blessings to those who remain faithful (James 1:12). The hidden manna, white stone, and new name are not just future rewards but present encouragements, reminding us that Jesus sustains, secures, and sanctifies us. May this promise strengthen your faith today, and may you find your satisfaction and identity in Him alone. "He who has an ear, let him hear."

  "Therefore let us leave the elementary doctrine of Christ and go on to maturity, not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward God, and of instruction about washings, the laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment. And this we will do if God permits. For it is impossible, in the case of those who have once been enlightened, who have tasted the heavenly gift, and have shared in the Holy Spirit, and have tasted the goodness of the word of God and the powers of the age to come, and then have fallen away, to restore them again to repentance, since they are crucifying once again the Son of God to their own harm and holding him up to contempt. For land that has drunk the rain that often falls on it, and produces a crop useful to those for whose sake it is cultivated, receives a blessing from God. But if it bears thorns and thistles, it is worthless and near to being cursed, and its end is to be burned. Though we speak in this way, yet in your case, beloved, we feel sure of better things—things that belong to salvation. For God is not unjust so as to overlook your work and the love that you have shown for his name in serving the saints, as you still do." (Hebrews 6:1-10, ESV)

The call to “leave the elementary doctrine of Christ” might sound jarring at first. But the author of Hebrews is not calling believers to abandon the foundational truths of the Gospel. On the contrary, he is urging them to build upon them. Just as a house rests firmly upon its foundation but does not remain a foundation alone, the Christian life must be rooted in core truths: repentance, faith, baptism, resurrection, judgment, but not remain stagnant in them.

This echoes Paul’s heart in Philippians 3:12–14, where he says he has not yet attained the goal but presses on toward the upward call in Christ. Growth in Christ is not about leaving behind what is true but going deeper into what is eternally essential. Maturity is not a new direction: it is a fuller dwelling in the truth we’ve received.

Yet the stakes are high. The author warns that it is impossible to restore again to repentance those who have tasted the heavenly gift and shared in the Holy Spirit, only to fall away (Hebrews 6:4–6). This is not a contradiction of grace, but a clarification of what real faith looks like. These are not believers who lost salvation, but people who were exposed to the truth, perhaps even thrilled by it, yet never truly converted.

This mirrors Jesus’ parable of the soils (Matthew 13:1–23). The seed is the same (the Word of God) but the results differ based on the soil’s depth and condition. Some sprout quickly and fall away when trials come. Others are choked by worldly cares. Only one bears lasting fruit. Similarly, in Matthew 7:21–23, Jesus warns that not all who say “Lord, Lord” will enter the kingdom, only those who do the will of His Father. The outward appearance of faith is not the same as inward transformation.

Even proximity to the truth can bring blessings, just as Israel was sustained by God in the wilderness despite their rebellion. Deuteronomy 29:5 tells us their clothes didn’t wear out. Nehemiah 9:20–21 recalls God’s gracious provision despite their hardness of heart. And yet, Hebrews 3:16–19 reminds us they fell short of entering God's rest because of unbelief.

In that same way, some live in the orbit of the Church, experience Christian fellowship, and benefit from its light, yet never truly yield to Christ. Paul says in 1 Corinthians 7:14 that even unbelieving spouses and children are sanctified in some way by the believer in their household. But proximity to grace is not the same as possession of it.

This is why fruit is essential. Jesus says a good tree cannot bear bad fruit (Matthew 7:18), and in John 15:1–6, He warns that those who do not abide in Him will be cut off. James concurs, declaring that faith without works is dead (James 2:17–26). Repentance is not a one-time emotional event, it is a lifelong posture, evidenced by fruit.

And yet, the warning is not the last word. In Hebrews 6:9–10, the author turns with pastoral hope: “Though we speak in this way, yet in your case, beloved, we feel sure of better things—things that belong to salvation.”

The readers have already shown love, service, and commitment to the saints. Their fruit is evident, and the writer wants to reassure them even while calling them to deeper growth. It’s a beautiful tension: a holy urgency mixed with a confident hope.

We too are called to examine ourselves, not to fear salvation is always slipping away, but to take seriously the costliness of Christ’s work and the depth of His calling. As 2 Corinthians 13:5 says, “Examine yourselves, to see whether you are in the faith.” But we do so not in dread, but with joy, trusting that “He who began a good work in you will bring it to completion” (Philippians 1:6).

Are you pressing on toward maturity in Christ, or merely resting near the foundation? Let us not drift. Let us grow. Let us bear fruit in keeping with repentance.

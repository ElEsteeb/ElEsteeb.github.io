  “Who was faithful to him who appointed him, just as Moses also was faithful in all God’s house. For Jesus has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses—as much more glory as the builder of a house has more honor than the house itself. (For every house is built by someone, but the builder of all things is God.) Now Moses was faithful in all God’s house as a servant, to testify to the things that were to be spoken later, but Christ is faithful over God’s house as a son. And we are his house, if indeed we hold fast our confidence and our boasting in our hope." (Hebrews 3:2-6, ESV)

To many today, the idea that Jesus is greater than Moses seems obvious. But to the original audience of Hebrews, this was monumental. Moses wasn’t just a prophet, he was THE prophet. The Law of God was often spoken of as the Law of Moses (Nehemiah 8:1, 8). Moses stood before Pharaoh as God’s voice and was told by the Lord, “You shall be as God to him” (Exodus 4:16). He was a mediator, a shadow of something greater. 

But Hebrews reminds us: Moses was a servant in the house, Jesus is the Son over the house. Moses reflected God’s glory from Mount Sinai, but it faded (2 Corinthians 3:7, 13). Christ is the radiance of God’s glory (Hebrews 1:3), and His glory does not fade, it transforms (2 Corinthians 3:18).

Moses delivered God’s Word; Jesus is the Word made flesh (John 1:14). Moses was barred from the promised land for disobedience (Numbers 20:12), but Jesus was perfectly obedient, even to death on a cross (Philippians 2:8). He is not “as God,” He is God (John 1:1; Colossians 2:9).

The Old Covenant served a purpose, but it was temporary, pointing us to the One who brings a better covenant (Hebrews 8:6). Now that Christ has come, the veil is lifted, and we see clearly. So we don’t cling to shadows, we hold fast to Christ.

And since we have such a hope, we are very bold (2 Corinthians 3:12). Bold in truth. Bold in grace. Bold in glory that will never fade.

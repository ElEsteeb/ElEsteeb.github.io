  "For when God made a promise to Abraham, since he had no one greater by whom to swear, he swore by himself, saying, “Surely I will bless you and multiply you.” And thus Abraham, having patiently waited, obtained the promise. For people swear by something greater than themselves, and in all their disputes an oath is final for confirmation. So when God desired to show more convincingly to the heirs of the promise the unchangeable character of his purpose, he guaranteed it with an oath, so that by two unchangeable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie, we who have fled for refuge might have strong encouragement to hold fast to the hope set before us." (Hebrews 6:13-18, ESV)

The writer of Hebrews continues his powerful appeal to the struggling believers: trust God. So far, we've been warned not to fall away as Israel did in the wilderness, who failed to enter God’s rest because of unbelief. But now, we’re shown the other side of that coin—the unshakable trustworthiness of God Himself.

This passage centers on God's promise to Abraham in Genesis 22:16–18. After Abraham’s obedience, God swore by Himself to bless and multiply him. Why does that matter? Because unlike human promises, God's word does not waver. As Numbers 23:19 reminds us, “God is not man, that he should lie.” And just in case His word wasn't enough, He backed it with an oath—two unchangeable things (His word and His oath)—to give us solid ground to stand on.

This addresses the ancient lie whispered in Eden: “Can God really be trusted?” Hebrews affirms: yes, absolutely. God’s promises rest on His unchanging character. James 1:17 reminds us that with God “there is no variation or shadow due to change.” Titus 1:2 even calls eternal life something promised by “God, who never lies.”

This gives us not a fragile wish but a secure hope, “an anchor of the soul” (v.19). And like Abraham, our trust must produce patient obedience. Romans 4:20–21 says Abraham “did not waver through unbelief” but was fully convinced that God was able to do what He promised.

In a world of shifting truths and broken promises, we’re called to hold fast to the One who never changes. The evidence of that trust isn’t simply words, but a life of enduring obedience—bearing the fruit of faith.

So let us remember today: God has told us to trust Him, yes—but more importantly, we can trust Him because He is who He says He is.

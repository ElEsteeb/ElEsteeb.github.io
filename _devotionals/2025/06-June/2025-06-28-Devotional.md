   "This makes Jesus the guarantor of a better covenant. The former priests were many in number, because they were prevented by death from continuing in office, but he holds his priesthood permanently, because he continues forever. Consequently, he is able to save to the uttermost those who draw near to God through him, since he always lives to make intercession for them. For it was indeed fitting that we should have such a high priest, holy, innocent, unstained, separated from sinners, and exalted above the heavens. He has no need, like those high priests, to offer sacrifices daily, first for his own sins and then for those of the people, since he did this once for all when he offered up himself. For the law appoints men in their weakness as high priests, but the word of the oath, which came later than the law, appoints a Son who has been made perfect forever." (Hebrews 7:22-28, ESV)

There is never a moment when Jesus is not interceding for those who belong to Him. That truth can be hard to grasp, especially for those who think of salvation as a one-time event. But Scripture teaches us that Jesus not only saves us at the beginning of our faith journey, He continually saves and sustains us every day we draw near to God through Him.

The former priests under the old covenant were limited: they had to offer sacrifices for their own sins as well as for the people (Hebrews 7:27). Their work was ongoing, their lives temporary, and their sacrifices ultimately insufficient. But Jesus is different. He is perfect, sinless (Hebrews 4:15; 2 Corinthians 5:21), and His priesthood is eternal (Hebrews 7:16). He offered Himself once for all as the perfect sacrifice (Hebrews 10:12–14), and because He lives forever, His work on our behalf never ceases.

Right now, Jesus stands in the presence of the Father, not offering new sacrifices, but as living proof that your sins, past, present, and future, have been paid for in full. When you stumble, you don't need to bring a new offering. Christ is the offering, and He is forever interceding for you (Romans 8:34; 1 John 2:1).

This doesn’t give us license to sin freely. As Paul reminds us, “Shall we continue in sin that grace may abound? By no means!” (Romans 6:1–2). Instead, we live as those who have died to sin and now walk in newness of life (Romans 6:6–14). We strive for holiness not to earn God's favor, but because in Christ, we already have it.

So take heart. When you fall short (and you will) run to the throne of grace, not away from it. Trust the One who stands forever in your place, interceding for you with a love that never fades.

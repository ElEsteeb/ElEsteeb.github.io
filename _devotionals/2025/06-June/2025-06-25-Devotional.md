  “See how great this man was to whom Abraham the patriarch gave a tenth of the spoils! And those descendants of Levi who receive the priestly office have a commandment in the law to take tithes from the people, that is, from their brothers, though these also are descended from Abraham. But this man who does not have his descent from them received tithes from Abraham and blessed him who had the promises. It is beyond dispute that the inferior is blessed by the superior. In the one case tithes are received by mortal men, but in the other case, by one of whom it is testified that he lives. One might even say that Levi himself, who receives tithes, paid tithes through Abraham, for he was still in the loins of his ancestor when Melchizedek met him.” (Hebrews 7:4–10, ESV)

In this passage, the writer of Hebrews unveils a truth both stunning and transformative: Jesus, our great High Priest, belongs to a priesthood far superior to the Levitical line—and this was always God's plan. Drawing from Genesis 14, the author shows that Melchizedek, king of Salem and priest of the Most High God, blessed Abraham and received tithes from him. In the biblical world, the greater blesses the lesser—and so Melchizedek is shown to be greater than Abraham.

This matters deeply. Abraham is not just any man—he is the father of Israel, and from him came Levi, the tribe of the priesthood. But Levi, as it were, bowed through Abraham to Melchizedek. The implication is clear: Melchizedek’s priesthood is greater. And if Jesus is a priest “after the order of Melchizedek” (Psalm 110:4), then His priesthood is greater than the entire Levitical system.

Why would God introduce a new priesthood unless the old one was insufficient? The law and its priests could not bring perfection (Hebrews 7:11), but Jesus could. The Levitical priests served under a temporary covenant, marked by human weakness and sin. Jesus, however, serves in the power of an indestructible life (Hebrews 7:16). He does not inherit priesthood by bloodline but by divine appointment—sworn by God Himself (Psalm 110:4). His priesthood is eternal, unchanging, and effective.

This priesthood also aligns with Abraham's original relationship to God—not by law, but by faith (Galatians 3:6–9). Jesus is the fulfillment of the promise, not merely the continuation of the pattern. His work brings about righteousness and access to God (Romans 5:18–19), something the old covenant could never accomplish.

So we rejoice in this truth:
Jesus is superior.
Superior to angels, prophets, and every earthly priest.
He fulfills the law(Matthew 5:17, Romans 10:4), completes the promises (Colossians 2:17, Galatians 3:24), and intercedes for us eternally.

  "Therefore, holy brothers, you who share in a heavenly calling, consider Jesus, the apostle and high priest of our confession” (Hebrews 3:1, ESV)
</div>

In Hebrews 2, we were reminded that Jesus took on flesh and blood, not to observe our suffering from a distance, but to enter into it fully. He was made like us in every respect so that He might become our merciful and faithful high priest (Heb. 2:17). He is not ashamed to call us brothers (Heb. 2:11), and as our Helper, He stands ready to give us strength when we are weak (Heb. 2:18).

Now, the writer shifts from that great truth to our response: “Consider Jesus.” This is not a casual glance or brief reflection. It is a deliberate, focused attention, a gaze fixed with intention and devotion. Why? Because Jesus is both the apostle: the One sent by God to us, and the high priest: the One who brings us to God. In Him, heaven has come down, and through Him, we are lifted up.

We are called “holy brothers,” a term rich in meaning. “Brothers” ties us to Christ and to each other in the family of God. But “holy” sets us apart. We are not of this world. As Jesus said of His disciples, “They are not of the world, just as I am not of the world” (John 17:16). This dual identity is at the heart of our faith: we are family in Christ and foreigners to the world.

The writer calls us those who “share in a heavenly calling.” This is our true citizenship. We are children of the promise "offspring of Abraham" not by bloodline, but by faith. Just as Abraham looked forward to a city whose designer and builder is God, we are pressing on in that inheritance. But how? Only by fixing our eyes on Jesus.

When Peter walked on water, he stood so long as his eyes were on Christ. The moment he looked away, he began to sink (Matt. 14:29-30). So it is with us. Jesus is not one among many voices, He is THE Word. He is not a part of our life, He IS our Life.

Let us then “pay much closer attention” (Heb. 2:1) to this Jesus who came for us, walks with us, and now represents us before the Father. Consider Him—again and again. In doing so, you will find the strength, clarity, and faith to walk in your heavenly calling.

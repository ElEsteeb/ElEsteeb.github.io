<div class="scripture">
  "For every high priest chosen from among men is appointed to act on behalf of men in relation to God, to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins. He can deal gently with the ignorant and wayward, since he himself is beset with weakness. Because of this he is obligated to offer sacrifice for his own sins just as he does for those of the people. And no one takes this honor for himself, but only when called by God, just as Aaron was. So also Christ did not exalt himself to be made a high priest, but was appointed by him who said to him, “You are my Son, today I have begotten you”" (Hebrews 5:1-5, ESV)

The writer of Hebrews continues to unfold one of the most precious truths in all of Scripture: Jesus is our Great High Priest. Like the priests of old, Jesus did not appoint Himself. He did not grasp or campaign for the position. He was appointed by the Father: chosen, called, and established by the Father, just as Aaron was.

Yet, Jesus is greater than any priest who came before Him. The earthly high priests were limited, they had to offer sacrifices for their own sins and were themselves weak. But Jesus, while sharing fully in our humanity, was without sin (Heb. 4:15). He is able to sympathize with our weaknesses not because He sinned, but because He fully entered our experience of temptation, pain, and suffering.

The author quotes Psalm 2:7, “You are my Son,” to show us that Jesus' priesthood flows from His identity as the eternal Son of God. Just as chapter 1 declared Jesus to be superior to the prophets and angels by virtue of being the Son, so now He is shown to be the greater High Priest, not merely because of function, but because of His very nature and divine appointment.

Even in these few verses, we already see why no future High Priest can ever take His place. He is the eternal Son, and thus the eternal Mediator. There is no need for another. He does not grow weak, or sinful, or die. He lives forever to intercede (Heb. 7:25) but even here, we glimpse the beginning of that truth.

So where should our hearts turn in light of this?

Back to the beautiful encouragement at the end of chapter 4:

“Since then we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession. … Let us then with confidence draw near to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need.”
(Hebrews 4:14, 16)

We have a High Priest who truly understands, who was appointed by the Father, and who stands in the heavenly places interceding for us. There is no better advocate. No greater priest. No more trustworthy Son.

Look to Him. Draw near. Hold fast.

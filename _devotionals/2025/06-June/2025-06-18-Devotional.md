  "Being designated by God a high priest after the order of Melchizedek. About this we have much to say, and it is hard to explain, since you have become dull of hearing. For though by this time you ought to be teachers, you need someone to teach you again the basic principles of the oracles of God. You need milk, not solid food, for everyone who lives on milk is unskilled in the word of righteousness, since he is a child. But solid food is for the mature, for those who have their powers of discernment trained by constant practice to distinguish good from evil" (Hebrews 5:10–14, ESV)

The writer of Hebrews begins to introduce the rich and mysterious topic of Melchizedek—only to pause and lament the spiritual dullness of his readers. Though they have heard the truth, they are not ready to go deeper. They have become complacent, satisfied with the basics. But spiritual life, like physical life, is not meant to remain in infancy.

This same burden is echoed throughout Scripture. Paul rebukes the Corinthians for needing milk rather than solid food (1 Cor. 3:1–3). He tells the Ephesians to grow up in every way into Christ and to no longer be children tossed about by every wind of doctrine (Eph. 4:14–15). Peter urges believers to grow in the grace and knowledge of Christ (2 Pet. 3:18). There is a clear expectation that what God plants, He intends to grow and bear fruit (Col. 1:9–10).

Childlike faith—marked by trust and humility (Matt. 18:3–4)—is to be cherished. But childish faith—marked by immaturity, instability, and selfishness—is something God calls us to outgrow (1 Cor. 13:11). Jesus warned that many hear the word but grow dull of heart and mind, unwilling to let truth penetrate deeply (Matt. 13:15).

Mature believers are not simply those who know more, but those who practice what they know. Hebrews says that solid food belongs to those “who have their powers of discernment trained by constant practice” (Heb. 5:14). As we grow in Christ, our ability to discern good from evil sharpens—not through intuition alone, but through Scripture, meditation, and daily obedience (Rom. 12:2; Phil. 1:9–11; Ps. 1:2–3).

This is not just an academic challenge, but a call to transformation. The Israelites were delivered from Egypt but perished in the wilderness because of unbelief (Heb. 3:12–19). So too, we must examine ourselves to see whether we are in the faith and growing in it. The riches of God’s wisdom are available to those who seek—not just to learn, but to live the truth.

Let us not grow dull of hearing. Let us press on—beyond milk—to maturity, discernment, and fruitfulness, delighting in the Word day and night (Ps. 1:2).

   “And it was not without an oath. For those who formerly became priests were made such without an oath, but this one was made a priest with an oath by the one who said to him: ‘The Lord has sworn and will not change his mind, “You are a priest forever.”’ This makes Jesus the guarantor of a better covenant.” (Hebrews 7:20–22, ESV)
</div>

Throughout redemptive history, priests served as mediators—standing between a holy God and sinful people. Under the old covenant, the priesthood was temporary and changeable. Priests lived, died, and were replaced. The covenant they mediated was always pointing forward to something greater. But now, in Jesus Christ, the shadows have passed, and the substance has come.

The author of Hebrews brings our attention to something God had never done with previous priests: He made Jesus a priest with an oath. God swore, "You are a priest forever" (Psalm 110:4), and that oath changes everything. It means Jesus’ priesthood isn’t temporary: it’s eternal. It means there will be no new high priest. No new order. No other new covenant. Because Jesus continues forever, there is no one who will come after Him. And there is no need.

The implications are massive. You don’t need another priest, a pope, a saint, or a special mediator to bring you closer to God. If you are in Christ, you already have the only High Priest you will ever need. Through Him, you have direct access to the throne of grace (Hebrews 4:14–16). And not only do you approach God—you belong to Him, forever.

Peter reminds us that we are now a royal priesthood (1 Peter 2:9), not because we stand between God and others, but because through Jesus, we all now draw near. No longer must we go through temple walls, veils, or intermediaries. Christ has torn down every barrier.

So be confident today—not in yourself, not in your religious efforts, and certainly not in any earthly mediator—but in Jesus, your eternal High Priest. The covenant He brings is better, because He Himself is better. And He will never be replaced.

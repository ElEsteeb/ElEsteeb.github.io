  “We have this as a sure and steadfast anchor of the soul, a hope that enters into the inner place behind the curtain, where Jesus has gone as a forerunner on our behalf, having become a high priest forever after the order of Melchizedek.” (Hebrews 6:19–20, ESV)
</div>

In a world constantly shifting beneath our feet, the Word of God offers us something profoundly secure: “a sure and steadfast anchor of the soul.” That anchor is Jesus Christ: unmoving, unwavering, utterly reliable.

Just before this passage, the writer of Hebrews reminds us that God is utterly trustworthy. Because He swore by Himself (Hebrews 6:13–18), His promises are unbreakable. Our hope, then, is not wishful thinking, it is anchored in the unchanging character of God. As the psalmist declared, “God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. Therefore we will not fear though the earth gives way” (Psalm 46:1–2). Christ is the stabilizing center of our lives.

But this anchor is not fixed in earthly ground, it is anchored in the very presence of God. Jesus has gone “behind the curtain,” not like the high priests of old who entered the Holy of Holies once a year (Leviticus 16), but into the heavenly sanctuary itself (Hebrews 9:11–12). There, He stands before the Father on our behalf, not with the blood of bulls and goats, but with His own blood, securing eternal redemption.

The danger the writer warned us about earlier, drifting away (Hebrews 2:1), is answered here. With Christ as our anchor, we are held firm, no longer at the mercy of the currents of sin, doubt, or suffering. He doesn’t just tether us to safety, He leads us there. “Jesus has gone as a forerunner on our behalf,” blazing the trail into God’s presence.

This is what Jesus meant when He said, “I go to prepare a place for you... I will come again and will take you to myself” (John 14:2–3). He is not merely our priest, He is the path, the pioneer, the door (John 10:9). As “the founder and perfecter of our faith” (Hebrews 12:2), He has walked where we must go. And He walks with us still.

This is why the apostles boldly declared, “There is salvation in no one else” (Acts 4:12), and why we can rest in the truth that “we have a living hope” (1 Peter 1:3–5). Christ is not only the content of our hope; He is its guarantee.

Let us draw near with confidence, knowing that Christ, our anchor, our priest, our forerunner, holds fast to us, even when we struggle to hold fast to Him.

  “To the rest I say (I, not the Lord) that if any brother has a wife who is an unbeliever, and she consents to live with him, he should not divorce her. If any woman has a husband who is an unbeliever, and he consents to live with her, she should not divorce him. For the unbelieving husband is made holy because of his wife, and the unbelieving wife is made holy because of her husband. Otherwise your children would be unclean, but as it is, they are holy. But if the unbelieving partner separates, let it be so. In such cases the brother or sister is not enslaved. God has called you to peace. For how do you know, wife, whether you will save your husband? Or how do you know, husband, whether you will save your wife?” (1 Corinthians 7:12–16, ESV)

Paul continues developing his contrast between the wisdom of the world and the Wisdom of the Spirit. The Corinthians, like many of us today, were tempted to measure relationships through the world’s lens: “Surround yourself only with those who support you, agree with you, and strengthen you.” Yet the Wisdom of the Spirit calls believers to a radically different posture: “In humility count others more significant than yourselves” (Philippians 2:3) and “look not only to your own interests, but also to the interests of others” (Philippians 2:4). This self-giving vision forms the heart of Paul’s instruction in 1 Corinthians 7:12–16.

When a believer comes to faith while their spouse remains an unbeliever, the world’s instinct is to dissolve the relationship. But Paul insists that faith does not dissolve covenant; rather, it brings blessing into it. “If any unbelieving partner consents to live with you, do not divorce them” (1 Corinthians 7:12–13). This echoes Jesus’ affirmation that covenant marriage is meant to endure (Matthew 19:4–6), and it reflects the wider biblical truth that the believer’s presence can bring blessing even to unbelievers. Joseph’s presence brought prosperity to Potiphar’s house because “the LORD blessed the Egyptian’s house for Joseph’s sake” (Genesis 39:5). Likewise, Paul teaches that the unbelieving spouse is “made holy,” not saved, but set apart under the sphere of God’s gracious influence (1 Corinthians 7:14). Even the children of such a union are considered “holy,” meaning they fall under covenant nearness, similar to the principle that God desires “godly offspring” (Malachi 2:15).

This does not contradict the command not to marry unbelievers (2 Corinthians 6:14); Paul is addressing a completely different scenario, not entering a mixed-faith marriage, but remaining faithful within one after conversion. The believer stays not for personal benefit, but for the spiritual good of the other. As Peter says, an unbelieving spouse may be “won without a word by the conduct” of the believer (1 Peter 3:1–2). Paul reinforces this hope when he asks, “How do you know whether you will save your husband… or your wife?” (1 Corinthians 7:16).

Yet Paul balances persistence with peace. If the unbeliever chooses to depart, “the brother or sister is not enslaved” (1 Corinthians 7:15). God does not call believers to strife or coercion, but to peace (Romans 12:18).

In the end, the call is simple: remain where God has placed you, shine the light of Christ in your home (Matthew 5:14–16), and trust that the grace of God working through you may bring salvation to those you love.

<div class="scripture">
  "Then I saw another angel flying directly overhead, with an eternal gospel to proclaim to those who dwell on earth, to every nation and tribe and language and people. And he said with a loud voice, 'Fear God and give him glory, because the hour of his judgment has come, and worship him who made heaven and earth, the sea and the springs of water.'" (Revelation 14:6-7, ESV)
</div>


In this powerful vision, John sees an angel proclaiming the eternal gospel to the nations. While this angel may symbolize a heavenly messenger, it also reflects the role of God's people in declaring His truth to the world. Just as the second beast in Revelation 13 spreads deception, believers are called to proclaim the true gospel with urgency and boldness.

The angel's message centers on two vital points: the call to "fear God and give him glory" and the reminder that "the hour of his judgment has come." This call to repentance and worship is not optional; it is essential. Every person must acknowledge Jesus as Lord and submit to His reign. The angel’s proclamation reflects the urgent responsibility of believers to share this truth. Romans 1 underscores this same reality, warning that God's wrath is revealed "against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men" (Romans 1:18). Those who suppress the truth and reject God's clear revelation are "without excuse" (Romans 1:20). The angel's message echoes this truth — judgment is not arbitrary, but a just response to humanity's willful rebellion.

Judgment is certain. Whether that judgment comes at the end of days or at the final breath of an individual, the time to turn to Christ is limited. As believers, we must grasp the weight of this reality. The gospel we carry is a message of salvation, but it also bears a warning — those who reject Christ will face God's righteous judgment.

The angel’s global proclamation reminds us that no one is excluded from this call. Our mission is clear: proclaim Christ to every nation, tribe, and language. The task is urgent because eternity hangs in the balance. Let this vision in Revelation stir us to speak boldly, trusting that God will work through our faithfulness to draw sinners to Himself.

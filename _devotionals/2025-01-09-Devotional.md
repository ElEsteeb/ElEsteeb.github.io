>**Revelation 2:7 ESV**
>"He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To the one who conquers I will grant to eat of the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God."

In Genesis 2:9, God placed the tree of life in the center of Eden, symbolizing eternal life and communion with Him. However, the fall in Genesis 3 introduced sin, separation, and death into the world. After Adam and Eve disobeyed God by eating from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, access to the tree of life was lost. Genesis 3:24 tells us that God stationed cherubim and a flaming sword to guard the way to the tree, ensuring that humanity would not eat of it and live forever in their sin (Genesis 3:22-24).

Yet, here, we see a reversal of this loss (Romans 5:18-19, John 3:16). The promise of access to the tree of life is restored, but it is not given to everyone—it is reserved for those who conquer. Conquering refers to remaining faithful to the truth of Christ, being willing to persevere in love. This victory is not achieved through human effort but through the power of Jesus, who has already overcome the world (John 16:33, 1 John 5:4-5).

This promise reminds us of God’s ultimate plan of redemption. Through Jesus’ death and resurrection, the curse of sin is broken. Revelation 22:1-5 further paints a picture of a restored paradise, where the tree of life stands in the New Jerusalem, its leaves bringing healing to the nations. There will no longer be any curse, and God’s people will dwell with Him forever in the Light of Life (John 1:4).

As we struggle with life’s difficulties, this passage offers hope. It assures us that faithfulness to Christ, both in rejecting false teachers and spreading the truth in love, has eternal rewards (2 Corinthians 4:17). No matter how challenging the path may seem, the promise of paradise and eternal life with Him awaits. This hope anchors us in times of hardship and reminds us of the ultimate victory we have in Jesus.

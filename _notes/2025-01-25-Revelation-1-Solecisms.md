## Introduction
Solecisms in the book of Revelation—especially in chapter 1—are widely recognized as part of the distinctive style of its author. These grammatical irregularities, present in the original Greek text, often deviate from standard Koine Greek conventions, contributing to both the book’s unique character and interpretive complexity. Below, I outline the notable solecisms in Revelation 1, providing the Greek and English text when appropriate, an explanation of why each is a solecism, and the grammatically corrected form.

## Revelation 1:4:
"Grace to you and peace from him who is and who was and who is to come" - The phrase "who is and who was and who is to come" is an unusual construction in Greek, especially for a greeting. The nominative ὁ ὢν is retained for theological emphasis, drawing on the Septuagint’s phrasing of Exodus 3:14 ("I AM WHO I AM") to highlight God's eternal existence. The standard grammar is subverted for rhetorical and theological purposes.

### Greek (NA28):
>Ἰωάννης ταῖς ἑπτὰ ἐκκλησίαις ταῖς ἐν τῇ Ἀσίᾳ· χάρις ὑμῖν καὶ εἰρήνη ἀπὸ ὁ ὢν καὶ ὁ ἦν καὶ ὁ ἐρχόμενος...

### Corrected Greek: 
>ἀπὸ τοῦ ὄντος (from the one who is).

## Revelation 1:5:
"and from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the firstborn of the dead, and the ruler of kings on earth" - Here, the use of multiple titles without conjunctions ("kai" in Greek) between each one, creates a list-like structure which is somewhat awkward in Greek grammar but is stylistically used for emphasis.

### Greek (NA28):
>καὶ ἀπὸ Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ, ὁ μάρτυς ὁ πιστός

### Corrected Greek:
>καὶ ἀπὸ Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ, τοῦ μάρτυρος τοῦ πιστοῦ

## Revelation 1:7:
>"Behold, he is coming with the clouds, and every eye will see him, even those who pierced him, and all tribes of the earth will wail on account of him."  
The phrase "even those who pierced him" introduces a parenthetical remark that disrupts the flow of the sentence, which is not typical in Greek prose but mirrors Hebrew prophetic style.

## Revelation 1:13-16:
The description of Jesus with various symbolic elements (like his hair, eyes, feet, voice, etc.) uses a series of nominative phrases that aren't strictly grammatically connected but are meant to build a vivid image. This could be seen as stylistically irregular or even solecistic because of the lack of clear grammatical linkage.

These "solecisms" are often interpreted in two ways:
Stylistic Choices: The author (John) might have intentionally used these irregularities for emphasis, rhythm, or to mimic apocalyptic or prophetic speech patterns.
Linguistic Features: Some might reflect the actual spoken Greek of the time, especially if John was not a native Greek speaker or was heavily influenced by Hebrew or Aramaic.

Understanding these as solecisms requires distinguishing between what was "incorrect" by classical standards and what was effective for the message Revelation was trying to convey. The text's style aligns with its purpose of conveying divine visions and prophecies, where conventional grammar might not be as important as the message itself.

>**Revelation 5:7-10 ESV**
>"And he went and took the scroll from the right hand of him who was seated on the throne. And when he had taken the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, each holding a harp, and golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints. And they sang a new song, saying, “Worthy are you to take the scroll and to open its seals, for you were slain, and by your blood you ransomed people for God from every tribe and language and people and nation, and you have made them a kingdom and priests to our God, and they shall reign on the earth.”

In this breathtaking scene, the Lamb of God, Jesus Christ, takes the scroll from the hand of the One seated on the throne. This act declares His authority to unfold God’s sovereign plan for history. The response is immediate—heaven erupts in worship, and the twenty-four elders fall before Him, holding golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints (v. 8). Our prayers are not forgotten or lost; they rise before the throne of God as a fragrant offering (Psalm 141:2). Every cry, every whispered petition, and every longing for Christ’s kingdom is treasured in heaven, contributing to the chorus of worship around the Lamb.

The worshippers sing a new song (v. 9), a song of redemption and triumph. This is not a mere repetition of past praises but a declaration of the Lamb’s completed work—the ransom He paid through His blood. The scope of His redemption is universal, gathering people from every tribe, language, and nation (Revelation 7:9). This song signals the fulfillment of God’s promise to make His redeemed a kingdom of priests (Exodus 19:6; 1 Peter 2:9). Those who were once alienated from God are now commissioned to reign with Christ (2 Timothy 2:12).

As the song of the redeemed rises, the sound swells into an immeasurable chorus—myriads of myriads and thousands of thousands (v. 11). Heaven’s praise is not isolated; it is overwhelming, unstoppable, and filled with the awe of God’s glory. One day, every voice in creation will join this anthem (Philippians 2:10-11). Until then, we participate in this heavenly worship through our prayers and our proclamation of the gospel. The Lamb is worthy, and we, as His redeemed, have the privilege of lifting our voices in the song that will never end.

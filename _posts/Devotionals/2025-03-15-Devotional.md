>**Revelation 10:5-7 ESV**
>"And the angel whom I saw standing on the sea and on the land raised his right hand to heaven [6] and swore by him who lives forever and ever, who created heaven and what is in it, the earth and what is in it, and the sea and what is in it, that there would be no more delay, [7] but that in the days of the trumpet call to be sounded by the seventh angel, the mystery of God would be fulfilled, just as he announced to his servants the prophets."

In this passage, the angel — whom we’ve identified as Jesus Himself — stands with one foot on the sea and one on the land. Showing His authority over Jew and Gentile alike. By raising His hand and swearing an oath, Jesus declares that the time of delay is over. Judgment is at hand, and with it, a new creation emerges.

The destruction of Jerusalem marked the end of the old covenant world. The temple, sacrifices, and rituals that once pointed to Christ were removed. What remained was the unveiled reality of the new covenant, where God’s people are no longer defined by earthly distinctions but by their unity in Jesus. As Paul writes, "If anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come" (2 Corinthians 5:17).

This “mystery of God” mentioned in verse 7 points to this very truth — the inclusion of Gentiles as full participants in God’s promises. Paul explains in Ephesians 3:6 that this mystery is "that the Gentiles are fellow heirs, members of the same body, and partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel." The old dividing walls were torn down, and God's kingdom now stretches across every nation.

As believers, we are part of this new creation. Our identity is no longer in earthly rituals, cultural status, or ethnic background, but in Christ alone. The world may still rage in turmoil, yet we rest in the security of His finished work — a kingdom that cannot be shaken (Hebrews 12:28).

The fulfillment of God’s plan is still unfolding, but we can trust that Jesus is on the throne, reigning over His people. In Him, we are part of something new — a creation that no enemy can destroy.

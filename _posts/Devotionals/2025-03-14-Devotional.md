>**Revelation 10:1-4 ESV**
>"Then I saw another mighty angel coming down from heaven, wrapped in a cloud, with a rainbow over his head, and his face was like the sun, and his legs like pillars of fire. [2] He had a little scroll open in his hand. And he set his right foot on the sea, and his left foot on the land, [3] and called out with a loud voice, like a lion roaring. When he called out, the seven thunders sounded. [4] And when the seven thunders had sounded, I was about to write, but I heard a voice from heaven saying, “Seal up what the seven thunders have said, and do not write it down.”'

In this striking vision, John sees a mighty angel, one who can only be identified as Jesus Himself. The angel’s appearance mirrors the description of Christ’s divine glory (Revelation 1:13-16). With one foot on the sea and the other on the land, Jesus stands as sovereign King over Jew and Gentile alike — a reminder that His reign extends to every corner of creation.

When the angel calls out, His voice is like a lion's roar. This recalls passages like Hosea 11:10: "They shall go after the LORD; he will roar like a lion; when he roars, his children shall come trembling from the west." Jesus, the Lion of Judah (Revelation 5:5), proclaims His authority over the nations. The seven thunders that follow seem to echo God's voice of approval, much like the Father’s words at Jesus' baptism (Matthew 3:17).

Yet John is told not to record what the thunders have said. This reminds us that while God reveals much, His full plan is not yet disclosed. The destruction of Jerusalem was not the end; God’s purposes would continue as the Gospel went out to all the nations (Matthew 24:14).

This silence reminds us to trust God when His plans seem unclear. Just as the early church endured hardship, seeing only part of God's design, so we too may face seasons of confusion or waiting. Yet Jesus’ roar still resounds, and His Gospel still advances.

Even when we don’t have all the answers, we can be sure of this: God’s plan is unfolding, and Christ reigns as King over all. Trust in Him, for the Lion who roars is also the Lamb who saves.

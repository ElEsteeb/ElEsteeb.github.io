>**Revelation 11:1-6 ESV **
>"Then I was given a measuring rod like a staff, and I was told, “Rise and measure the temple of God and the altar and those who worship there, but do not measure the court outside the temple; leave that out, for it is given over to the nations, and they will trample the holy city for forty-two months. And I will grant authority to my two witnesses, and they will prophesy for 1,260 days, clothed in sackcloth.” These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands that stand before the Lord of the earth. And if anyone would harm them, fire pours from their mouth and consumes their foes. If anyone would harm them, this is how he is doomed to be killed. They have the power to shut the sky, that no rain may fall during the days of their prophesying, and they have power over the waters to turn them into blood and to strike the earth with every kind of plague, as often as they desire."

In this passage, the two witnesses appear to represent the Law and the Prophets — God's Word testifying to Jesus as the Messiah. Jesus Himself said, "If you believed Moses, you would believe me; for he wrote of me" (John 5:46). The Law, given through Moses, and the Prophets, who foretold the Messiah, together bore witness to Christ.

Yet tragically, Jerusalem rejected that testimony. The very Word that pointed to their salvation became the evidence that condemned them. Jesus warned of this when He said, "The word that I have spoken will judge him on the last day" (John 12:48). By rejecting the Word of God, the people of Israel set themselves against the truth — and that truth ultimately testified against them.

The power of these witnesses is striking. Like Moses, they could turn water to blood. Like Elijah, they could call down fire and shut the heavens. These signs reflect God’s Word as both a source of life and a warning of judgment. When believed, Scripture brings salvation. When rejected, it stands as a witness against us.

This reality is sobering. God's Word is not neutral; it either leads us to repentance and life or confirms our rebellion and judgment. As the author of Hebrews writes, "For the word of God is living and active, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing to the division of soul and of spirit, of joints and of marrow, and discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart." (Hebrews 4:12).

Today, let the Word of God speak to you. Do not resist its truth. Instead, believe in the One to whom it points — Jesus Christ — and walk in His light.
